    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.",
      "ct": "Pursue love above all, and eagerly seek spiritual gifts, especially the ability to prophesy."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.",
      "ct": "Anyone who speaks in an unknown tongue isn't communicating with people but with God. No one can understand them — they're speaking mysteries through the spirit."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.",
      "ct": "But the person who prophesies is speaking to people, building them up, encouraging them, and bringing them comfort."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.",
      "ct": "Speaking in an unknown tongue only builds up the speaker, but prophesying builds up the entire church."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.",
      "ct": "I wish all of you could speak in tongues, but even more, I wish you would prophesy. The person who prophesies is more valuable than the one who speaks in tongues — unless that person also provides an interpretation so the church can be built up."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?",
      "ct": "Brothers and sisters, if I came to you speaking in tongues, how would that help you? It wouldn't — unless I also brought you a revelation, some knowledge, a prophecy, or teaching."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?",
      "ct": "Consider even lifeless instruments that produce sound, like a flute or a harp. If they don't play distinct notes, how will anyone recognize the melody?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?",
      "ct": "And if a trumpet produces a confusing signal, who would get ready for battle?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.",
      "ct": "It's the same with you. Unless your tongue produces words that are easy to understand, how will anyone know what you're saying? You'll just be talking to the air."
    },

      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.",
      "ct": "There are countless different languages in the world, and every one of them carries meaning."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.",
      "ct": "But if I don't understand someone's language, I'll be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me."

      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.",

      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.",
      "ct": "Therefore, anyone who speaks in an unknown tongue should pray for the ability to interpret what they say."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.",
      "ct": "If I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit is praying, but my mind gains nothing from it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.",
      "ct": "So what should I do? I'll pray with my spirit, and I'll also pray with my mind. I'll sing with my spirit, and I'll also sing with my mind."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?",
      "ct": "Otherwise, if you're praising God only in the spirit, how can an outsider who doesn't understand say \"Amen\" to your prayer of thanks? They have no idea what you're saying."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.",
      "ct": "You may be giving thanks beautifully, but the other person isn't being built up by it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:",
      "ct": "I'm grateful to God that I speak in tongues more than any of you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.",
      "ct": "But in a church gathering, I'd rather speak 5 words that everyone can understand — so I can teach others — than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.",
      "ct": "Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. When it comes to evil, be as innocent as infants, but in your thinking, be mature adults."
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.",
      "ct": "It's written in the Law: 'Through people speaking foreign languages and through the lips of outsiders I will speak to this nation, and even then they won't listen to me,' says the Lord."
    },
    {
      "verse": 22,
      "kjv": "Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.",
      "ct": "So then, tongues serve as a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy serves not for unbelievers but for believers."
    },
    {
      "verse": 23,
      "kjv": "If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?",
      "ct": "So if the whole church gathers together and everyone is speaking in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers walk in, won't they think you've all lost your minds?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 24,
      "kjv": "But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:",
      "ct": "But if everyone is prophesying and an unbeliever or outsider walks in, they'll be convicted by what everyone is saying. They'll be examined by it all."

      "verse": 26,
      "kjv": "How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.",
      "ct": "So what's the conclusion, brothers and sisters? When you gather together, one person has a psalm, another has a teaching, another has a tongue, another has a revelation, another has an interpretation. Everything should be done to build each other up."

    {
      "verse": 27,
      "kjv": "If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.",
      "ct": "If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, limit it to 2 or at most 3 people, taking turns, and someone must interpret."
    },
    {
      "verse": 28,
      "kjv": "But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.",
      "ct": "If no interpreter is present, the tongue-speaker should stay quiet in the church and speak only to themselves and to God."

      "ct": "If they want to learn about something, they should ask their husbands at home, because it's considered disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church assembly."
