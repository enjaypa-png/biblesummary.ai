    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.",
      "ct": "If I could speak in every human language and even the language of angels, but didn't have love, I would just be a loud gong or a clanging cymbal."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.",
      "ct": "If I had the gift of prophecy, and could grasp every mystery and possess all knowledge, and if I had such complete faith that I could move mountains, but didn't have love, I would be nothing."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.",
      "ct": "If I gave away everything I owned to feed the hungry, and if I surrendered my body to be burned, but didn't have love, I would gain absolutely nothing from it."

      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;",
      "ct": "It doesn't act dishonorably, doesn't insist on its own way, isn't quick to get angry, and doesn't keep a record of wrongs."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;",
      "ct": "It takes no pleasure in injustice but celebrates the truth."

    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.",
      "ct": "Love never fails. Prophecies will come to an end. Speaking in tongues will stop. Knowledge will fade away."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.",

      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.",
      "ct": "When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I grew up, I left childish ways behind."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.",
      "ct": "Right now we see only a dim reflection, like looking into a cloudy mirror, but one day we will see clearly, in full presence. Right now I know only partially, but one day I will understand fully, just as I am fully understood."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.",
