      "web": "Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.",
      "ct": "Now, about food that has been sacrificed to idols: we all think we understand this issue. But knowledge by itself just makes people arrogant. It's love that actually builds people up."

      "web": "Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.",
      "ct": "So when it comes to eating food that was sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one."

      "kjv": "Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.",
      "web": "However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.",
      "ct": "Not everyone understands this, though. Some people are so used to thinking of idols as real that when they eat food sacrificed to an idol, their conscience treats it as an act of idol worship. Because their conscience is weak, it becomes stained with guilt."

      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.",
      "web": "But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.",
      "ct": "Food doesn't affect our standing with God. We're no worse off if we don't eat it, and no better off if we do."

      "kjv": "For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;",
      "web": "For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?",
      "ct": "Think about it: if someone with a weak conscience sees you — someone who \"knows better\" — eating in an idol's temple, won't they be encouraged to eat that food too, even though it violates their conscience?"

      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?",
      "web": "And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.",
      "ct": "So your \"knowledge\" ends up destroying a weak brother or sister — someone for whom Christ died."
