    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.",
      "ct": "There are widespread reports of sexual immorality among you — and a kind of immorality that doesn't even occur among pagans: a man is sleeping with his father's wife."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.",
      "ct": "Yet you are proud of yourselves! Shouldn't you have been grieving instead? The person who did this should have been removed from your community."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,",
      "ct": "Even though I'm not physically there with you, I am with you in spirit, and I have already passed judgment on the man who committed this act — as if I were right there in person."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",

    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?",
      "ct": "Your boasting is not appropriate. Don't you realize that just a small amount of yeast works its way through an entire batch of dough?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:",
      "ct": "Get rid of the old yeast so that you can be a fresh batch of dough — since you really are unleavened. After all, Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed for us."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
      "ct": "So let us celebrate the feast — not with the old yeast, not with the yeast of hatred and evil, but with the unleavened bread of honesty and truth."

      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:",
      "ct": "In my previous letter, I told you not to associate with sexually immoral people."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.",
      "ct": "I didn't mean the sexually immoral people of the outside world, or the greedy, or the swindlers, or idol worshipers. If that were the case, you'd have to leave the world entirely."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.",
      "ct": "What I'm saying is that you should not associate with anyone who claims to be a fellow believer but is sexually immoral, greedy, an idol worshiper, verbally abusive, a drunkard, or a swindler. Don't even share a meal with someone like that."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?",
      "ct": "Why would it be my business to judge outsiders? Isn't it those inside your community that you are supposed to judge?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.",
      "ct": "God will judge those on the outside. Remove the wicked person from among you."
