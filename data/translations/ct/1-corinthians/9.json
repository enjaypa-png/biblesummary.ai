      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.",
      "ct": "Even if others don't consider me an apostle, you certainly should. Your very existence as believers in the Lord is the proof of my role as an apostle."

      "kjv": "Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?",
      "ct": "Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who don't have the right to stop working for a living?"

      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?",
      "ct": "What soldier serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and doesn't eat any of its fruit? Who takes care of a flock and doesn't drink any of its milk?"
    },

      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?",

    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?",
      "ct": "In the law of Moses it says, \"You must not put a muzzle on an ox while it is threshing grain.\" Is God really just concerned about oxen?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.",
      "ct": "Wasn't he actually saying this for our benefit? Absolutely, this was written for us — because the one who plows should plow with expectation, and the one who threshes should work expecting to share in the harvest."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?",
      "ct": "If we planted spiritual things among you, is it too much to ask that we receive material support from you?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.",
      "ct": "If others have this right to your support, don't we deserve it even more? But we haven't used this right. Instead, we put up with anything rather than create an obstacle for the gospel of Christ."

      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?",

    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.",
      "ct": "But I haven't taken advantage of any of these rights. And I'm not writing this so that you'll start providing for me now. I would rather die than let anyone take away this reason I have to be proud."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!",
      "ct": "When I preach the gospel, I can't take credit for it, because I'm compelled to do it. It would be terrible for me if I didn't preach the gospel!"

      "kjv": "What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.",
      "ct": "So what is my reward? It's this: that when I preach the gospel, I offer it free of charge, and so I don't take full advantage of my rights as a gospel preacher."

      "kjv": "And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;",
      "ct": "When I'm with Jewish people, I live like a Jewish person to win them over. When I'm with those who follow the law, I live as someone under the law — even though I'm not under it myself — so I can win those who are under the law."
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.",
      "ct": "When I'm with those who don't have the law, I live as someone without the law — though I'm not free from God's law but am under Christ's law — so I can win those without the law."
