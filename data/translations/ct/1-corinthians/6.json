    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?",
      "ct": "How can any of you, when you have a dispute with another believer, take it to be settled by ungodly judges instead of bringing it before God's people?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?",
      "ct": "Don't you realize that God's people will judge the world? And if you are going to judge the world, aren't you capable of settling minor disputes?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?",
      "ct": "Don't you realize that we will judge angels? How much more should we be able to handle ordinary matters of everyday life?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.",
      "ct": "So if you have disputes about everyday matters, why would you bring them before people who have no standing in the church?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?",
      "ct": "I'm saying this to embarrass you. Is there really no one wise enough among you to settle a disagreement between brothers and sisters?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.",
      "ct": "Instead, one believer takes another believer to court — and in front of unbelievers at that!"
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?",
      "ct": "The very fact that you have lawsuits against each other is already a complete failure. Why not just accept being wronged? Why not just let yourselves be cheated?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.",
      "ct": "Instead, you yourselves are the ones doing wrong and cheating — and you're doing it to your own brothers and sisters."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,",
      "ct": "Don't you know that unrighteous people will not receive the kingdom of God? Don't fool yourselves: those who are sexually immoral, idol worshipers, adulterers, men who engage in sexual acts with other men,"
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.",
      "ct": "thieves, greedy people, drunkards, verbal abusers, and swindlers — none of them will receive the kingdom of God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.",
      "ct": "Some of you used to live that way. But you have been washed clean, you have been set apart as holy, you have been declared righteous through the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.",
      "ct": "\"Everything is permissible for me\" — but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible for me\" — but I refuse to let anything control me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.",
      "ct": "\"Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach exists for food\" — but God will put an end to both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.",
      "ct": "God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us up too by his power."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.",
      "ct": "Don't you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself? Should I then take what belongs to Christ and unite it with a prostitute? Absolutely not!"
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.",
      "ct": "Don't you know that anyone who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her? As Scripture says, \"The 2 will become one flesh.\""
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.",
      "ct": "But whoever is united with the Lord becomes one spirit with him."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.",
      "ct": "Run from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the person who is sexually immoral sins against their own body."
    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?",
      "ct": "Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who lives in you, whom you received from God? You don't belong to yourselves."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.",
      "ct": "You were purchased at a cost. So honor God with your body and with your spirit, since both belong to God."
