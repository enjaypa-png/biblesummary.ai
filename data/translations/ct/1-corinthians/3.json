    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.",
      "ct": "Brothers and sisters, I wasn't able to talk to you as spiritually mature people. Instead, I had to speak to you as people still controlled by your human nature — like infants in Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.",
      "ct": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you weren't ready for it. And honestly, you're still not ready."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?",
      "ct": "You're still being controlled by your human nature. As long as there is jealousy, conflict, and division among you, aren't you acting just like everyone else in the world?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?",
      "ct": "When one of you says, \"I follow Paul,\" and another says, \"I follow Apollos,\" aren't you just acting like ordinary people?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?",
      "ct": "After all, who is Paul? Who is Apollos? We are simply servants through whom you came to faith, each doing the role the Lord assigned to us."

    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.",
      "ct": "So the one who plants doesn't really matter, and the one who waters doesn't really matter — only God matters, because he is the one who makes things grow."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.",
      "ct": "The one who plants and the one who waters share the same purpose, and each one will receive their own reward based on their own work."

      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.",
      "ct": "Using the grace of God that was given to me, I laid the foundation like a skilled master builder, and someone else is now building on top of it. But everyone needs to be careful about how they build on that foundation."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
      "ct": "No one can lay any other foundation besides the one that has already been laid, which is Jesus Christ."

      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;",
      "ct": "Now someone might build on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.",
      "ct": "Each person's work will eventually be exposed, because the day of judgment will bring it to light. It will be revealed through fire, and the fire will test the quality of everyone's work."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.",

      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.",
      "ct": "If someone's work is burned up, they will suffer the loss. They themselves will still be saved, but only as someone escaping through flames."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",
      "ct": "Don't you realize that you are God's temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.",
      "ct": "If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person. Because God's temple is holy — and that temple is you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.",
      "ct": "Don't fool yourselves. If any of you thinks you are wise by this world's standards, you should become a \"fool\" so that you can become truly wise."
    },

      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.",
