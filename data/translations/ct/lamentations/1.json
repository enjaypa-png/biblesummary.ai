      "ct": "How empty the city sits now — she who was once crowded with people! She has become like a widow. She who was powerful among the nations, a queen among the provinces, has been reduced to forced labor!"

      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.",
      "ct": "She cries bitterly through the night, tears streaming down her face. Out of all who claimed to love her, not one offers comfort. Every ally has betrayed her; they have all turned into her enemies."

      "ct": "The roads to Zion grieve because no one travels them for the appointed festivals. All her gates stand deserted. Her priests groan, her young women suffer, and she herself is overwhelmed with anguish."

      "kjv": "Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.",

      "ct": "Her uncleanness clings to her clothing; she never considered where her choices would lead. Her collapse was shocking, and she has no one to comfort her. LORD, look at my suffering, because the enemy has grown arrogant!"

      "verse": 10,

      "verse": 17,
