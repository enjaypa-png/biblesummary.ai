      "ct": "I went because God revealed to me that I should. I presented to them the gospel message that I proclaim among the Gentiles. But I did this privately with the recognized leaders, to make sure that my efforts — both past and present — weren't wasted."

      "kjv": "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?",
      "ct": "But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of everyone, \"You are a Jew, yet you've been living like a Gentile and not following Jewish customs. So how can you pressure Gentiles to live like Jews?\""

      "kjv": "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",
      "ct": "Yet we know that no one is made right with God by following the law, but rather through faith in Jesus Christ. So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus, in order to be made right with God through faith in Christ and not by following the law — because no human being will be made right with God by following the law."

      "kjv": "But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.",
      "ct": "But if, in seeking to be made right with God through Christ, we ourselves turn out to be sinners too, does that make Christ a promoter of sin? Absolutely not!"

      "ct": "I have been crucified with Christ. I am still alive, but it's no longer me living — it's Christ living in me. The life I now live in this body, I live through faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
