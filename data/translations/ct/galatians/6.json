      "kjv": "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",
      "ct": "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, those of you who are spiritually mature should gently help that person get back on track. But watch yourself carefully, so that you don't end up falling into temptation too."

    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.",
      "ct": "If anyone thinks they are important when they really aren't, they are only fooling themselves."

    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "For every man shall bear his own burden.",

      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.",
      "ct": "Don't be fooled — no one makes a mockery of God. Whatever a person plants, that is exactly what they will harvest."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.",
      "ct": "Whoever plants seeds to satisfy their sinful nature will harvest decay and destruction from that nature. But whoever plants seeds to please the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit."

      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.",
      "ct": "So let's not get tired of doing what is right, because at just the right time we will gather a harvest — as long as we don't give up."

      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.",

    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",
      "ct": "Even those who are circumcised don't actually follow the law themselves. They just want you circumcised so they can brag about your submission to that ritual."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.",
      "ct": "But as for me, I will never brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through that cross, the world has been put to death as far as I'm concerned, and I have been put to death as far as the world is concerned."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.",
      "ct": "Because when it comes to being united with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor the lack of it matters at all. What matters is being made into an entirely new creation."
