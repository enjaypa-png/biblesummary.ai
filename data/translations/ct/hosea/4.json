    {
      "verse": 6,

      "ct": "My people are destroyed because they lack knowledge. Since you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you from serving as my priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children."

      "ct": "It will be the same for the people as for the priest — I will punish them for their behavior and repay them for what they have done."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.",
      "ct": "They will eat but never be satisfied. They will pursue prostitution but will not grow in number, because they have abandoned the LORD."

      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.",
      "ct": "They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops and burn incense on the hills, under oak trees, poplar trees, and elm trees, because the shade is pleasant. That is why your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.",
      "ct": "I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves go off with prostitutes and offer sacrifices alongside temple prostitutes. A people without understanding will be ruined."
