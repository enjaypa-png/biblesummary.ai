    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.",
      "ct": "So let us be careful, because the promise of entering God's rest still stands, and we don't want any of you to miss out on it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.",
      "ct": "The good news was announced to us just as it was to them. But the message they heard didn't do them any good, because they didn't combine it with faith when they heard it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.",
      "ct": "Now, we who have believed are the ones who enter that rest. As God said, 'In my anger I declared on oath: They will never enter my rest' — even though his work has been completed since the creation of the world."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.",
      "ct": "Somewhere in Scripture he spoke about the 7th day like this: 'God rested on the 7th day from all his work.'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.",
      "ct": "And yet in the other passage he says again, 'They will never enter my rest.'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:",
      "ct": "So the opportunity to enter that rest still remains open, since those who first received the good news failed to enter because of their refusal to believe."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.",
      "ct": "Therefore, God set another specific day. Much later, speaking through David, he said, 'Today, if you hear his voice, don't harden your hearts.'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.",
      "ct": "If Joshua had truly given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.",
      "ct": "So a Sabbath rest still remains for God's people."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.",
      "ct": "Anyone who enters God's rest also stops working, just as God stopped after completing his own work."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.",
      "ct": "Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one falls by following the same pattern of disobedience."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.",
      "ct": "God's word is living and powerful, sharper than any double-edged sword. It cuts deep enough to separate soul from spirit, and joints from marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.",
      "ct": "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.",
      "ct": "Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens — Jesus, the Son of God — let us hold firmly to what we profess."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.",
      "ct": "Our high priest is not someone who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses. He was tempted in every way that we are, yet he never sinned."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.",
      "ct": "So let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us right when we need it."
