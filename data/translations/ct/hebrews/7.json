      "kjv": "And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:",
      "ct": "Now, the descendants of Levi who serve as priests are required by the law to collect tithes from the people — that is, from their own brothers, even though they are all descended from Abraham."

      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.",

      "ct": "So if the Levitical priesthood could have brought people to spiritual completeness (since the law was built on that priesthood), why would there be any need for a different kind of priest — one in the order of Melchisedec rather than the order of Aaron?"
