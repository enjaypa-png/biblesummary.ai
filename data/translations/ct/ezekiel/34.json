      "ct": "\"Son of man, speak out against the leaders of Israel. Prophesy and tell them, 'This is what the Lord GOD says to the shepherds: How terrible it will be for the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Aren't shepherds supposed to take care of the flock?'"

      "ct": "You haven't nursed the weak back to health, you haven't treated the sick, you haven't bandaged the injured, you haven't gone after the ones that strayed, and you haven't searched for the ones that were lost. Instead, you've ruled over them harshly and brutally."
