      "kjv": "For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.",
      "ct": "\"Because I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the dying, will not search for the young, will not heal the injured, or feed the healthy. Instead, he will eat the meat of the choice sheep and rip off their hooves.\""
