      "ct": "Look at how incredible the love is that the Father has given to us — that we would be called children of God! And that's exactly what we are. The reason the world doesn't recognize us is that it never recognized him either."

      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.",
      "ct": "This is how you can tell the difference between God's children and the devil's children: anyone who does not practice righteousness does not belong to God, and neither does anyone who fails to love their brother or sister."
