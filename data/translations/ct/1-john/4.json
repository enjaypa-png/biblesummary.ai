    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.",
      "ct": "Dear friends, don't trust every spirit. Instead, test the spirits to see if they come from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:",
      "ct": "Here is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ came in a physical body is from God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.",
      "ct": "But any spirit that does not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in a physical body is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming — and it is already in the world right now."

    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.",
      "ct": "We belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who doesn't belong to God won't listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of deception."

    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.",

    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.",
      "ct": "We have come to know and trust the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.",

      "ct": "There is no fear in love. Instead, fully developed love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The person who is afraid has not yet been brought to maturity in love."

    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?",
      "ct": "If someone claims, 'I love God,' but hates a fellow believer, that person is a liar. After all, if you can't love a brother or sister you can actually see, how could you possibly love God, whom you cannot see?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.",
