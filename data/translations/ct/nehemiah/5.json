      "ct": "The previous governors who served before me had burdened the people heavily, taking food and wine from them plus 40 shekels of silver. Even their servants exploited the people. But I refused to do this out of my wholehearted dedication to God."

      "ct": "Every day, the food prepared at my expense included 1 ox, 6 prime sheep, and poultry. Every 10 days, a large supply of various wines was also provided. Despite all this expense, I never demanded the governor's food allowance, because the burden on these people was already crushing enough."
