      "ct": "They will be scattered out under the sun, the moon, and all the stars of heaven — the very things they loved, served, followed, consulted, and worshiped. No one will collect them or rebury them. They will lie like manure on the surface of the earth."

      "ct": "Because of this, I will hand their wives over to other men and their fields to new owners. Everyone, from the lowest to the highest, is consumed by greed. From prophet to priest, every one of them practices deception."
