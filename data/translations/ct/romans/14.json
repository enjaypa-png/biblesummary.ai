    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.",

      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.",
      "ct": "The person who honors a special day does so for the Lord. The person who eats anything does so for the Lord, since they give thanks to God. And the person who refrains from eating also does so for the Lord, and they too give thanks to God."

      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.",
