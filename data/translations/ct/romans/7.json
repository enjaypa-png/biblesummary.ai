    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?",
      "ct": "Brothers and sisters, don't you understand — since I'm talking to people who are familiar with the law — that the law only has authority over a person during their lifetime?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.",
      "ct": "For example, a married woman is legally tied to her husband while he is alive. But if her husband dies, she is released from that legal obligation to him."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.",
      "ct": "So if she gets together with another man while her husband is still living, she would be considered an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and she is not an adulteress even if she marries someone else."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.",
      "ct": "In the same way, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you could belong to someone else — to the one who was raised from the dead — and produce fruit for God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.",
      "ct": "When we were controlled by our sinful nature, the sinful desires stirred up by the law were at work throughout our bodies, producing fruit that leads to death."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.",
      "ct": "But now we have been released from the law, because we died to what once held us captive. This means we serve in the new way of the Spirit, not in the old way of the written code."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.",
      "ct": "So what are we saying? That the law itself is sin? Absolutely not! On the contrary, I wouldn't have recognized sin without the law. I wouldn't have understood what coveting was if the law hadn't said, 'You must not covet.'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.",
      "ct": "But sin seized the opportunity through the commandment and produced every kind of desire in me. Without the law, sin has no power."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.",
      "ct": "There was a time when I was alive apart from the law, but when the commandment arrived, sin sprang to life and I died."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.",
      "ct": "The very commandment that was intended to bring life turned out to bring death for me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.",
      "ct": "Sin seized the opportunity through the commandment, tricked me, and through it killed me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.",
      "ct": "So the law itself is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.",
      "ct": "Did something good, then, become the cause of my death? Absolutely not! Rather, it was sin — working death in me through what is good — so that sin would be exposed for what it truly is. Through the commandment, sin became utterly sinful."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.",
      "ct": "We know that the law is spiritual, but I am made of flesh, sold as a slave to sin."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.",
      "ct": "I don't even understand my own actions. I don't do what I want to do; instead, I do the very thing I despise."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.",
      "ct": "If I do what I don't want to do, then I'm agreeing that the law is good."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",
      "ct": "So it's no longer really me doing it, but sin living inside me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.",
      "ct": "I know that nothing good lives in me — that is, in my sinful nature. The desire to do right is there, but I can't carry it out."
    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.",
      "ct": "I don't do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep doing the evil I don't want to do."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",
      "ct": "If I keep doing what I don't want to do, then it's no longer really me doing it, but sin that lives inside me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.",
      "ct": "So I discover this pattern: whenever I want to do good, evil is right there alongside me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 22,
      "kjv": "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:",
      "ct": "Deep inside, I genuinely love God's law."
    },
    {
      "verse": 23,
      "kjv": "But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.",
      "ct": "But I see a different principle at work in my body, fighting against what my mind knows is right and making me a prisoner to the principle of sin operating in my body."
    },
    {
      "verse": 24,
      "kjv": "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?",
      "ct": "What a miserable person I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 25,
      "kjv": "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.",
      "ct": "Thanks be to God — the answer is through Jesus Christ our Lord! So this is my situation: with my mind I serve God's law, but with my sinful nature I serve the law of sin."
