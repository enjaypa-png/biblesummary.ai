      "ct": "The law was unable to accomplish this because human weakness made it powerless. So God sent his own Son in a body like our sinful bodies, and as an offering for sin, he condemned sin right there in human flesh."
    },

      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.",
      "ct": "So then, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation — but it is not to our sinful nature, to live according to it."
