      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:",
      "ct": "He received circumcision as a sign, a seal confirming the righteousness that came through faith while he was still uncircumcised. This happened so that he would become the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be credited to them as well."

      "ct": "That's why the promise is based on faith, so that it would be an act of grace — guaranteeing it for all of Abraham's descendants. Not just for those who follow the law, but also for those who share Abraham's faith. He is the father of all of us."
