      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.",
      "ct": "Don't offer the parts of your body to sin as tools for wrongdoing. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have been brought from death to life, and offer the parts of your body to God as tools for righteousness."
