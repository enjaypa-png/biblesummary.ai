    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.",
      "ct": "Everyone must submit to the governing authorities. No authority exists apart from God, and the authorities that are in place have been established by God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.",
      "ct": "So anyone who rebels against the authority is opposing what God has put in place, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:",
      "ct": "Rulers aren't a threat to people who do right — only to those who do wrong. Do you want to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is good, and they will commend you for it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.",
      "ct": "The ruler serves as God's agent for your benefit. But if you do wrong, you should be afraid, because the ruler doesn't carry the sword for nothing. He serves as God's agent, carrying out punishment and justice against anyone who does evil."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.",
      "ct": "That is why you must submit — not just to avoid punishment, but because your conscience demands it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.",
      "ct": "This is also why you pay taxes, because the authorities are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very responsibility."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.",
      "ct": "Give to everyone what you owe them: taxes to those you owe taxes, revenue to those you owe revenue, respect to those who deserve respect, and honor to those who deserve honor."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.",
      "ct": "Don't owe anyone anything, except the ongoing debt to love each other. Whoever loves others has fulfilled the law."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",
      "ct": "The commands — \"You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not give false testimony, you must not desire what belongs to others\" — along with every other commandment, are all summed up in this single statement: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\""
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.",
      "ct": "Love does no harm to a neighbor. So love is the complete fulfillment of the law."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.",
      "ct": "Understand the urgency of this moment: it's time to wake up from your sleep, because our salvation is closer now than when we first put our faith in Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.",
      "ct": "The night is almost over, and the day is nearly here. So let's strip off the deeds that belong to darkness and put on the armor of light."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.",
      "ct": "Let's live with integrity, as people who belong to the daylight — not in wild partying and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and reckless indulgence, not in conflict and jealousy."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.",
      "ct": "Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and stop planning ways to satisfy your sinful desires."
