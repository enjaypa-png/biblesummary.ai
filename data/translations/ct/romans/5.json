      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:",
      "ct": "That is why, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death came through sin, death spread to every person, because everyone has sinned."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.",

      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.",
      "ct": "Yet death still ruled from Adam all the way to Moses, even over those who didn't sin in the same way Adam did by breaking a direct command. Adam serves as a pattern pointing to the one who was coming."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.",
      "ct": "But the free gift is nothing like the offense. For if the many died because of one man's offense, how much more has God's grace — and the gift that comes through the grace of one man, Jesus Christ — overflowed to the many."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.",
      "ct": "The gift is also not like the result of one man's sin. The judgment that followed one sin led to condemnation, but the free gift that followed many offenses led to being made right with God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)",
      "ct": "For if death ruled because of one man's offense through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.)"
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.",
      "ct": "So then, just as one offense brought condemnation for all people, so also one act of righteousness brought the free gift of being made right with God and receiving life for all people."

      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:",
