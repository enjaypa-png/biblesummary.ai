      "kjv": "Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.",
      "ct": "This is what the LORD says: Where is your mother's certificate of divorce showing that I sent her away? Which of my creditors did I sell you to? No — you were sold because of your own sins, and your mother was sent away because of your rebellions."

      "kjv": "Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.",
      "ct": "Why was no one there when I came? Why did no one answer when I called? Is my arm too weak to rescue? Do I lack the strength to save? Look — with just a command I dry up the sea and turn rivers into desert. Their fish rot because there is no water, dying of thirst."
