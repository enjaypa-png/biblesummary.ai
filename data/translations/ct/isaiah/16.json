      "kjv": "For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.",
      "ct": "The fields of Heshbon are withering, and so are the grapevines of Sibmah. The rulers of the nations have trampled their finest vines — vines that once reached as far as Jazer and spread into the desert. Their branches stretched out and crossed over the sea."

      "verse": 10,

      "ct": "Celebration and happiness have been stripped from the fertile fields. No one sings in the vineyards anymore, and no one shouts with joy. No one treads grapes in the winepresses. I have put an end to the shouts of the harvest."
