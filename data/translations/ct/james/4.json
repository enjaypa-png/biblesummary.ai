      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.",

      "kjv": "Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.",
      "ct": "Don't talk badly about each other, brothers and sisters. Whoever speaks against a fellow believer and passes judgment on them is actually speaking against the law and judging the law. But if you judge the law, you're not following it — you're setting yourself above it."
    },

      "kjv": "There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?",
