      "kjv": "In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.",
      "ct": "When that day comes, people will mock you with a taunting song and cry out in bitter grief, saying, 'We are completely ruined! He has taken away my people's land. How it has been stripped from me! He has divided up our fields and given them to traitors.'"

      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?",

      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.",

      "kjv": "Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.",
      "ct": "Get up and leave! This is no longer your place of rest. Because it has been made unclean, it will bring you destruction — total and devastating destruction."

      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.",

      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.",
      "ct": "I will certainly gather all of you together, Jacob. I will bring together the survivors of Israel. I will unite them like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture — the place will be buzzing with the noise of so many people."
