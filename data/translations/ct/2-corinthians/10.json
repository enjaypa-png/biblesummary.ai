    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:",
      "ct": "I, Paul, personally appeal to you with the same meekness and gentleness that Christ shows. Some say I'm timid when I'm with you in person but courageous only when I'm far away."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.",
      "ct": "I'm asking you — please don't make me use that bold confidence when I arrive, the kind I'm prepared to use against those who accuse us of operating by purely human motives."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:",
      "ct": "Yes, we live in human bodies, but we don't fight our battles using human methods."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)",
      "ct": "The weapons we fight with aren't worldly ones. Instead, they carry God's power to tear down fortresses."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;",
      "ct": "We demolish false arguments and every arrogant idea that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive and make it submit to Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.",
      "ct": "We are also ready to deal with every act of disobedience, once your own obedience is complete."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.",
      "ct": "You're judging by outward appearances! If anyone is convinced that they belong to Christ, they should consider this again — we belong to Christ just as much as they do."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:",
      "ct": "Even if I were to take my boasting about our authority a bit further — authority the Lord gave us to build you up, not to tear you down — I wouldn't have any reason to be embarrassed."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.",
      "ct": "I don't want it to seem like I'm just trying to scare you with my letters."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.",
      "ct": "Some people are saying, 'His letters are impressive and forceful, but in person he's unimpressive, and his speaking ability is worthless.'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.",
      "ct": "People like that should understand this: whatever we say through letters when we're away, that's exactly how we'll act when we show up in person."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.",
      "ct": "We wouldn't dare put ourselves in the same category as certain people who promote themselves, or compare ourselves to them. When they measure themselves against each other and compare themselves with one another, they show a complete lack of understanding."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.",
      "ct": "We, however, won't boast beyond proper limits. Instead, we'll stay within the boundaries of the assignment God gave us — and that assignment includes reaching all the way to you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:",
      "ct": "We aren't overstepping our boundaries, as if our mission didn't extend to you. After all, we were the first ones to come all the way to you with the good news of Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,",
      "ct": "We don't take credit beyond our limits by boasting about work that others have done. Instead, our hope is that as your faith continues to grow, our area of influence among you will expand greatly within our proper boundaries,"
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.",
      "ct": "so that we can share the good news in the regions beyond you. We have no interest in boasting about work already accomplished in someone else's territory."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.",
      "ct": "If anyone is going to boast, let them boast about what the Lord has done."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.",
      "ct": "It's not the person who promotes themselves who receives approval — it's the one whom the Lord endorses."
