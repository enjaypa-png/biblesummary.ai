    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:",
      "ct": "There's really no need for me to write to you about this collection for God's people."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.",
      "ct": "I already know how eager you are to help. I've been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia, telling them that Achaia has been ready since last year. Your enthusiasm has motivated so many others."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:",
      "ct": "But I'm sending the brothers ahead so that our bragging about you won't turn out to be empty on this point. I want you to actually be ready, just as I told them you would be."

      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.",
      "ct": "Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we would be humiliated — not to mention how embarrassed you would be — after all this confident talk."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.",
      "ct": "That's why I felt it was necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance the generous gift you had already promised. That way it will be ready as a true act of generosity, not something squeezed out of you reluctantly."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.",
      "ct": "Here's the principle: whoever plants only a little will harvest only a little, and whoever plants generously will harvest generously."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.",
      "ct": "Each person should give whatever they've decided in their heart to give — not reluctantly or under pressure — because God loves someone who gives with joy."

    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:",

      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.",
      "ct": "As Scripture says: 'He has scattered his gifts freely; he has given to those in need; his righteousness lasts forever.'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)",
      "ct": "The one who provides seed for the farmer and bread for food will also supply and multiply what you've planted, and will grow the harvest of your righteousness."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.",
      "ct": "You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will produce thanksgiving to God."
    },

      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;",
      "ct": "Through the proof of this service, they will praise God because of your obedient commitment to the gospel of Christ and because of your generous sharing with them and with everyone."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.",
