      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.",
      "ct": "Make room for us in your hearts. We haven't harmed anyone, we haven't led anyone astray, and we haven't taken advantage of anyone."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.",
      "ct": "I'm not saying this to place blame on you. As I've told you before, you hold such a place in our hearts that we would die with you or live with you."

      "verse": 4,

      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.",
      "ct": "When we arrived in Macedonia, we had no relief at all. We were pressured from every direction — conflicts on the outside, anxieties on the inside."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;",
      "ct": "But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us through the arrival of Titus."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.",
      "ct": "It wasn't just his arrival that lifted us up, but also the encouragement he had received from you. He told us about your deep longing, your grief, and your passionate concern for me, which made me even more joyful."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.",
      "ct": "Even though my letter caused you pain, I don't regret it now — though I did regret it at first. I can see that the letter hurt you, but only for a short time."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.",
      "ct": "Now I'm glad — not because you were hurt, but because your pain led you to repentance. Your grief was the kind God intended, so that we didn't end up causing you any real harm."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.",
      "ct": "The kind of grief God intends produces repentance that leads to salvation, and there's no regret in that. But the kind of grief the world produces leads to death."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.",
      "ct": "Just look at what this God-intended grief produced in you: what seriousness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what outrage, what reverence, what intense longing, what passion, what determination to see justice done! At every point you've demonstrated that you are innocent in this situation."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.",
      "ct": "So even though I wrote to you, it wasn't really about the person who did the wrong, or even about the person who was wronged. It was so that your devotion to us would become clear to you in God's sight."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.",
      "ct": "That's why we were so encouraged. On top of our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by how happy Titus was, because all of you had put his spirit at ease."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.",
      "ct": "If I had bragged about you to him at all, you didn't let me down. Just as everything we told you was truthful, so the good things we said about you to Titus turned out to be true as well."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.",
      "ct": "His affection for you grows even deeper when he remembers how all of you responded with such respect and reverence when you welcomed him."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.",
