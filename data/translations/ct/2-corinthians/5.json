    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.",
      "ct": "We know that if this earthly tent we live in — our body — is destroyed, we have a building from God, a permanent home in the heavens that wasn't made by human hands."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:",
      "ct": "While we are in this body, we groan with longing, deeply wanting to put on our heavenly dwelling."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.",
      "ct": "Because once we are clothed with it, we won't be left exposed and without a body."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.",
      "ct": "While we live in this tent, we groan under its weight — not because we want to be stripped of our body, but because we want to be covered with the new one, so that what is mortal gets absorbed by life."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.",
      "ct": "God himself is the one who has prepared us for this very purpose, and he has given us the Spirit as a guarantee of what's coming."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:",
      "ct": "So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we are at home in this body, we are away from the Lord."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)",
      "ct": "(After all, we live by faith, not by what we can see.)"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.",
      "ct": "We are confident, and we would actually prefer to leave this body and be at home with the Lord."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.",
      "ct": "That is why we make it our goal to please him, whether we remain in this body or leave it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.",
      "ct": "For all of us must stand before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each person will receive what they deserve for the things they did while in the body, whether good or bad."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.",
      "ct": "Since we understand what it means to deeply revere the Lord, we try to persuade people. God sees us clearly for who we are, and I hope your consciences recognize that too."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.",
      "ct": "We aren't trying to promote ourselves to you again. Instead, we're giving you a reason to be proud of us, so you'll have an answer for those who boast about outward appearances rather than what's in the heart."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.",
      "ct": "If we seem out of our minds, it's for God's sake. If we are thinking clearly, it's for your benefit."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:",
      "ct": "The love of Christ compels us, because we have reached this conclusion: since one person died for everyone, that means everyone had died."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.",
      "ct": "He died for everyone so that those who are alive would no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died and was raised for them."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.",
      "ct": "So from now on, we don't evaluate anyone by human standards. Even though we once viewed Christ that way, we no longer see him like that."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.",
      "ct": "So if anyone is in Christ, that person is a new creation. The old has disappeared — look, everything has become new!"
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;",

    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.",
      "ct": "In other words, God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not counting people's sins against them. And he has entrusted us with this message of reconciliation."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.",
      "ct": "So we serve as ambassadors for Christ, as if God were making his appeal through us. On behalf of Christ, we urge you: be reconciled to God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.",
      "ct": "God took the one who had no sin and made him become sin for us, so that through him we could become the righteousness of God."
