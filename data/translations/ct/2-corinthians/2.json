    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.",
      "ct": "I made up my mind that I would not visit you again under painful circumstances."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?",
      "ct": "Because if I cause you pain, then who is left to bring me joy except the very people I've hurt?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.",
      "ct": "That's exactly why I wrote to you — so that when I arrived, I wouldn't be caused grief by the people who should be giving me joy. I have complete confidence in all of you that my joy is shared by every one of you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.",
      "ct": "I wrote to you out of deep distress and a heavy heart, with many tears — not to make you feel bad, but so you would understand the overwhelming love I have for you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.",
      "ct": "If someone has caused pain, he hasn't just hurt me — he has hurt all of you to some degree, though I don't want to be too harsh in saying that."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.",
      "ct": "The punishment that the majority of you imposed on this person has been enough."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.",
      "ct": "Instead, you should now forgive and encourage him, so that he isn't overwhelmed and crushed by excessive grief."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.",
      "ct": "That is why I urge you to reaffirm your love for him."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.",
      "ct": "This was also part of why I wrote — to test you and see whether you would be obedient in every respect."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;",
      "ct": "When you forgive someone, I forgive them too. Whatever I have forgiven — if there was anything to forgive — I did it for your sake in the presence of Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.",
      "ct": "We can't let Satan outsmart us, because we are well aware of his schemes."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,",
      "ct": "Now, when I arrived in Troas to proclaim the good news about Christ, the Lord opened up a great opportunity for me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.",
      "ct": "But my spirit had no peace because I couldn't find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to the people and left for Macedonia."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.",
      "ct": "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession through Christ and spreads the fragrance of knowing him through us everywhere we go."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:",
      "ct": "To God, we are the sweet aroma of Christ — both among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?",
      "ct": "To those who are perishing, we are the smell of death leading to death. But to those being saved, we are the fragrance of life leading to life. Who could possibly be equal to such a task?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.",
      "ct": "Unlike so many others, we don't peddle God's word for profit. Instead, we speak in Christ with complete sincerity, as people sent from God, accountable to God."
