    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?",
      "ct": "Are we starting to promote ourselves again? Do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:",
      "ct": "You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, recognized and read by everyone."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.",
      "ct": "It's clear that you are a letter from Christ, delivered through our work — written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on the tablets of human hearts."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:",
      "ct": "This is the confidence we have before God through Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;",
      "ct": "It's not that we're capable of claiming anything based on our own ability; our capability comes from God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.",
      "ct": "He is the one who has equipped us to serve the new covenant — not a covenant of the written code, but of the Spirit. The written code brings death, but the Spirit gives life."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:",
      "ct": "Now if the ministry that brought death — carved in letters on stone — came with such glory that the people of Israel couldn't keep looking at Moses' face because of its radiance, even though that radiance was fading,"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?",
      "ct": "won't the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.",
      "ct": "If the ministry that brought condemnation had glory, how much more does the ministry that brings righteousness overflow with glory!"
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.",
      "ct": "In fact, what once had glory has lost its glory entirely when compared to the glory that far surpasses it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.",
      "ct": "Because if what was fading away came with glory, what remains permanent carries so much more glory."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:",
      "ct": "Since we have this kind of hope, we speak with complete boldness."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:",
      "ct": "We are not like Moses, who placed a veil over his face so the people of Israel couldn't watch the end of what was fading away."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.",
      "ct": "But their thinking became hardened. To this very day, that same veil remains when the old covenant is read — it has never been lifted, because only in Christ is it removed."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.",
      "ct": "Even today, whenever Moses' writings are read, a veil covers their hearts."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.",
      "ct": "But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",
      "ct": "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.",
      "ct": "And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord reflected as in a mirror, are being transformed into that same image with ever-increasing glory — and this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
