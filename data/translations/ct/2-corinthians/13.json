    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.",
      "ct": "This will be my 3rd visit to you. As Scripture says, every matter must be confirmed by the testimony of 2 or 3 witnesses."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:",
      "ct": "I already warned you during my 2nd visit, and now while I'm away I'm warning you again — those who sinned before and everyone else should know that when I come back, I won't hold back."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.",
      "ct": "You're demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you — he is powerful among you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.",
      "ct": "Yes, he was crucified in weakness, but he lives by God's power. In the same way, we share in his weakness, but through God's power we will live with him as we deal with you."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?",
      "ct": "Test yourselves to see if you are truly living in the faith. Evaluate yourselves. Don't you recognize that Jesus Christ is in you — unless you actually fail the test?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.",
      "ct": "I'm confident that you'll discover we have not failed that test."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.",
      "ct": "I pray to God that you won't do anything wrong — not so that we look like we've passed the test, but so that you do what is right, even if we end up looking like failures."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.",
      "ct": "We can't do anything to oppose the truth — only to support it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.",
      "ct": "We're actually glad when we are weak and you are strong. What we pray for is your complete growth and maturity."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.",
      "ct": "That's why I'm writing all this while I'm still away — so that when I arrive, I won't have to be harsh with you, using the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.",
      "ct": "In closing, brothers and sisters, goodbye. Aim for maturity, take encouragement, be united in your thinking, live at peace with each other — and the God of love and peace will be with you."
    },
