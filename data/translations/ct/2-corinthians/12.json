      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.",
      "ct": "Even if I chose to boast, I wouldn't be foolish, because I'd be telling the truth. But I'll hold back so that no one thinks more highly of me than what they can see in my life or hear from my words."

    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.",

      "ct": "But he told me, 'My grace is all you need, because my power reaches its full potential in weakness.' So I will gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may settle on me."

      "kjv": "Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.",
      "ct": "That's why I'm content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake. Because when I am weak, that's when I am strong."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.",
      "ct": "I've made a fool of myself by boasting like this, but you forced me into it. You should have been the ones speaking up for me, since I'm not the least bit inferior to those so-called 'super-apostles' — even though I'm nothing on my own."

      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",
      "ct": "Look, this is the 3rd time I'm prepared to visit you, and I won't be a burden to you. I'm not after your money — I want you. After all, children shouldn't have to save up for their parents; parents should save up for their children."

    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?",
      "ct": "I urged Titus to visit you and sent our brother along with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn't we operate with the same spirit? Didn't we follow the same path?"

      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.",
      "ct": "Have you been thinking all along that we're defending ourselves to you? We speak in the presence of God as people who belong to Christ, and everything we do, dear friends, is for building you up."

    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:",
      "ct": "My concern is that when I arrive, I won't find you the way I want to, and you won't find me the way you want me to be. I'm worried there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish rivalries, slander, gossip, arrogance, and chaos among you."

      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.",
      "ct": "I'm afraid that when I come again, my God will humble me in front of you, and I'll end up grieving over many who sinned before and still haven't turned away from the moral corruption, sexual immorality, and shameless behavior they've been practicing."
