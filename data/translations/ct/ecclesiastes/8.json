      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.",
      "ct": "Who can compare to a truly wise person? Who else can figure out what things really mean? Wisdom brightens a person's expression and softens even the hardest look."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.",
      "ct": "My advice is to obey the king's orders, especially because of the oath you made before God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.",
      "ct": "Don't rush away from the king's presence, and don't get involved in something wrong, because the king does whatever he wants."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?",
      "ct": "The king's word carries absolute authority, and no one can challenge him by asking, 'What are you doing?'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.",
      "ct": "Whoever obeys the king's command will avoid trouble, and a wise person's mind knows the right time and the right approach."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.",
      "ct": "There is a proper time and way for everything, yet people still suffer greatly under their burdens."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?",
      "ct": "No one knows what the future holds, and who can tell anyone when things will happen?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.",
      "ct": "No one has the power to hold onto their spirit and keep it from leaving. No one has authority over the day of their death. There is no way out of that battle, and wickedness cannot rescue those who practice it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.",
      "ct": "I observed all of this as I carefully studied everything that happens under the sun. There are times when one person has power over another, and it leads to harm."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.",
      "ct": "I also saw wicked people given honorable burials — they had walked in and out of the holy place, and yet they were praised in the very city where they had done evil. This too is meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.",
      "ct": "When punishment for a crime isn't carried out quickly, people become emboldened to do wrong."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:",
      "ct": "Even though a sinner may do evil 100 times and still live a long life, I'm certain that things will go well for those who deeply revere God — those who are wholeheartedly devoted to him."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.",
      "ct": "But things will not go well for the wicked. Their days will pass like a shadow and will not last, because they have no reverence for God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.",
      "ct": "Something meaningless happens on this earth: there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked people who get what the righteous deserve. I concluded that this too is meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.",
      "ct": "So I recommended enjoyment, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat, drink, and find happiness. This is what stays with someone through all the hard work of the life that God gives them under the sun."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)",
      "ct": "When I devoted myself to understanding wisdom and observing all the activity that takes place on earth — even going without sleep day and night —"
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.",
      "ct": "I examined everything God has done and realized that no one can fully understand what happens under the sun. No matter how hard people search, they cannot figure it out. Even if a wise person claims to understand it, they still cannot truly grasp it."
