    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.",
      "ct": "Watch your step when you go to the house of God. It's better to come ready to listen than to offer the sacrifice that fools bring, because they don't even realize they're doing wrong."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.",
      "ct": "Don't be quick to speak, and don't rush to make promises to God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so keep your words to a minimum."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice is known by multitude of words.",
      "ct": "Just as too much work brings restless dreams, too many words reveal someone as a fool."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.",
      "ct": "When you make a vow to God, don't put off fulfilling it. He takes no pleasure in fools — follow through on what you promised."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.",
      "ct": "It's better not to make a vow at all than to make one and fail to keep it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?",
      "ct": "Don't let your mouth lead you into sin, and don't tell the angel afterward that it was a mistake. Why give God reason to be angry at what you said and ruin everything you've worked for?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.",

      "kjv": "If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.",
      "ct": "If you see the poor being oppressed and justice being twisted violently in your region, don't be shocked by it. Every official has someone higher watching over him, and above them all are even higher authorities."

    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.",
      "ct": "Whoever loves money will never have enough of it, and whoever loves wealth will never be satisfied with what comes in. This too is meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?",
      "ct": "As wealth grows, so do the people consuming it. What real advantage does the owner get, other than watching it with his own eyes?"

      "kjv": "As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.",
      "ct": "Just as a person comes naked from his mother's womb, he will leave the same way he arrived. He can't take a single thing from all his hard work with him."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?",

    {
      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.",
      "ct": "Furthermore, when God gives someone wealth and possessions and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their share and find satisfaction in their work — that is a gift from God."
    },

      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.",
