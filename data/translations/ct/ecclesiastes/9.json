    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.",
      "ct": "I thought all of this through carefully and concluded that those who are righteous and wise, along with everything they do, are in God's hands. No one can tell whether love or hatred awaits them in what lies ahead."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.",
      "ct": "The same fate comes to everyone — to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the morally pure and the impure, to those who offer sacrifices and those who don't. What happens to the good person happens to the sinner too; the one who makes oaths and the one who avoids them end up the same."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.",
      "ct": "This is the worst thing about everything that happens in this world: the same fate awaits everyone. On top of that, people's hearts are full of evil, and insanity drives them throughout their lives — and then they join the dead."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.",
      "ct": "But anyone who is still among the living has hope, because a living dog is worth more than a dead lion."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.",
      "ct": "At least the living are aware that they will die, but the dead don't know anything at all. They have no further reward, and even their memory fades away."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.",
      "ct": "Their love, their hatred, and their jealousy have all vanished. They will never again have any part in anything that happens in this world."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.",
      "ct": "So go ahead — eat your food with happiness and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, because God has already approved of what you do."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.",
      "ct": "Always wear fine clothes, and keep oil on your head."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.",
      "ct": "Enjoy life with the wife you love through all the fleeting days that God has given you in this world — all your fleeting days. That is your reward in life and in the work you do in this world."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.",
      "ct": "Whatever task you find to do, throw yourself into it with all your energy, because in the grave where you are headed, there is no work, no planning, no knowledge, and no wisdom."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.",
      "ct": "I also observed something else in this world: the fastest runner doesn't always win the race, the strongest soldier doesn't always win the battle, the wisest person doesn't always have food, the most intelligent don't always get rich, and the most skilled don't always receive recognition — because timing and circumstances affect them all."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.",
      "ct": "People never know when their time will come. Like fish caught in a cruel net or birds trapped in a snare, people are caught off guard by disaster when it suddenly falls on them."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:",
      "ct": "I also witnessed an example of wisdom in this world that made a deep impression on me:"
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:",
      "ct": "There was a small city with only a few people in it. A powerful king marched against it, surrounded it, and constructed massive siege works around it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.",
      "ct": "Inside the city lived a poor but wise man, and through his wisdom he saved the city. Yet afterward, nobody remembered that poor man."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.",
      "ct": "So I concluded that wisdom is more valuable than strength. But still, a poor person's wisdom gets dismissed, and no one pays attention to what he says."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.",
      "ct": "The calm words of a wise person are more effective than the shouting of a ruler surrounded by fools."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.",
      "ct": "Wisdom accomplishes more than weapons of war, but a single person doing wrong can destroy a great deal of good."
