      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.",
      "ct": "Then I turned my attention to all the acts of oppression happening in this world. I saw the tears of those being oppressed, and no one was there to comfort them. Their oppressors held all the power, and there was no one to comfort them."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.",
      "ct": "That is why I considered the dead, who have already passed away, to be better off than the living, who are still going through this life."
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.",
      "ct": "Yet even better off than both is the person who has never existed — who has never witnessed the terrible things that happen in this world."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.",
      "ct": "I also observed that all hard work and every skillful achievement only produces jealousy from others. This too is pointless and like chasing the wind."
    },
    {
      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.",
      "ct": "The fool sits idle with folded hands and wastes away because of it."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.",
      "ct": "One handful gained with peace of mind is better than two handfuls gained through exhausting effort and chasing the wind."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.",
      "ct": "Then I turned my attention to something else that is pointless in this world."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.",
      "ct": "Here is someone completely alone — no partner, no child, no sibling — yet there is no end to his work, and his eyes are never satisfied with wealth. He never stops to ask, 'Who am I working so hard for? Why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?' This too is pointless — a miserable way to live."

      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.",
      "ct": "Two people are better off than one, because together they get a much better return for their effort."

      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.",
      "ct": "If one of them stumbles, the other can help pick them up. But how terrible for the person who falls down alone, with no one there to help them back to their feet."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?",
      "ct": "Also, if two people sleep side by side, they keep each other warm. But how can someone stay warm alone?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.",
      "ct": "A person standing alone can be overpowered, but two can defend themselves. A rope made of 3 strands is not easily snapped."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.",
      "ct": "A young person who is poor but wise is better off than an old king who is foolish and refuses to accept advice anymore."

    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.",
      "ct": "That young person may rise from prison to become ruler, while the one born into royalty ends up in poverty."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.",
      "ct": "I watched everyone living in this world rally behind the next young leader who rises to take the king's place."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.",
      "ct": "There is no limit to the crowds who follow him, yet those who come later will not celebrate him either. This too is pointless and like chasing the wind."
