    {
      "verse": 1,
      "kjv": "I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.",
      "ct": "I told myself, 'Come on, let me test you with pleasure — go ahead and enjoy yourself.' But look, this too was meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 2,
      "kjv": "I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?",
      "ct": "I concluded that laughter is foolish, and about pleasure I asked, 'What does it actually accomplish?'"
    },
    {
      "verse": 3,
      "kjv": "I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.",
      "ct": "I explored in my mind how to indulge myself with wine while still guiding my mind with wisdom, and how to embrace foolishness — until I could discover what is truly worthwhile for people to do under heaven during their brief lives."
    },
    {
      "verse": 4,
      "kjv": "I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:",

      "verse": 5,
      "kjv": "I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:",
      "ct": "I designed gardens and parks, and planted every kind of fruit tree in them."
    },
    {
      "verse": 6,
      "kjv": "I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:",
      "ct": "I constructed reservoirs to irrigate the groves where trees were growing."
    },
    {
      "verse": 7,
      "kjv": "I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:",
      "ct": "I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my household. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "kjv": "I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.",
      "ct": "I accumulated silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and provinces. I hired male and female singers, and enjoyed what delights people most — many women."
    },
    {
      "verse": 9,
      "kjv": "So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.",
      "ct": "So I became greater and wealthier than anyone who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and through it all, my wisdom stayed with me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "kjv": "And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.",
      "ct": "Whatever my eyes wanted, I didn't deny them. I refused my heart no pleasure, because my heart found satisfaction in all my efforts — and that satisfaction was my reward for all my work."
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "kjv": "Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.",
      "ct": "But then I stepped back and examined everything my hands had accomplished, all the effort I had poured into it, and look — it was all meaningless, like chasing the wind. Nothing of lasting value was gained under the sun."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "kjv": "And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.",
      "ct": "Then I turned my attention to consider wisdom alongside madness and foolishness. After all, what can the person who comes after the king do? Only what has already been done."
    },
    {
      "verse": 13,
      "kjv": "Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.",
      "ct": "I recognized that wisdom surpasses foolishness just as light surpasses darkness."
    },
    {
      "verse": 14,
      "kjv": "The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.",
      "ct": "A wise person sees where they're going, but a fool stumbles around in the dark. Yet I also realized that the same fate overtakes them both."
    },
    {
      "verse": 15,
      "kjv": "Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.",
      "ct": "So I thought to myself, 'If the same fate that hits the fool will hit me too, then what's the advantage of being wise?' I concluded in my heart that this too is meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 16,
      "kjv": "For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.",
      "ct": "Because neither the wise person nor the fool will be remembered forever — in the days ahead, both will be completely forgotten. The wise person dies just like the fool."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "kjv": "Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.",
      "ct": "So I grew to hate life, because everything done under the sun was distressing to me — it's all meaningless, like chasing the wind."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "kjv": "Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.",
      "ct": "Yes, I hated everything I had worked so hard for under the sun, because I would have to leave it all to whoever comes after me."
    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "kjv": "And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.",
      "ct": "And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over everything I worked for and applied my wisdom to under the sun. This too is meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "kjv": "Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.",
      "ct": "So I let my heart sink into despair over all the effort I had invested under the sun."
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "kjv": "For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.",
      "ct": "Because here's a person who works with wisdom, knowledge, and skill — and then has to hand over everything to someone who never worked for it at all. This too is meaningless and a terrible injustice."
    },
    {
      "verse": 22,
      "kjv": "For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?",
      "ct": "What does a person really gain from all their hard work and anxious striving under the sun?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 23,
      "kjv": "For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.",
      "ct": "Every day brings pain, and their occupation is filled with frustration. Even at night their mind won't rest. This too is meaningless."
    },
    {
      "verse": 24,
      "kjv": "There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.",
      "ct": "There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in their soul through their work. I recognized that even this comes from the hand of God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 25,
      "kjv": "For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?",
      "ct": "For who can eat or find enjoyment apart from him?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 26,
      "kjv": "For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.",
      "ct": "To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy. But to the sinner, he gives the task of collecting and stockpiling — only to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, like chasing the wind."
