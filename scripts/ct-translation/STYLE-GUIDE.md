# Clear Translation (CT) — Style Guide

## Purpose

The Clear Translation (CT) is a simplified, modern-English rendering of the Bible
designed for BibleSummary.ai. It sits alongside the King James Version (KJV) to
give readers an accessible entry point to Scripture.

## Core Principles

### 1. Faithful to Meaning
- Convey the same meaning as the original KJV text
- Do not add theological interpretation or commentary
- Do not remove or skip content — every verse must be represented
- Preserve the verse-by-verse structure (same verse numbers as KJV)

### 2. Modern English
- Replace archaic language: thee/thou → you, hath → has, begat → became the father of
- Use natural, contemporary sentence structure
- Target a 6th–8th grade reading level
- Write in a voice that feels warm and accessible, not clinical

### 3. Simple Sentence Structure
- Break long KJV compound sentences into shorter ones when it helps readability
- Avoid embedded clauses where possible
- One main idea per sentence

### 4. Consistent Terminology
- Use the same English word for recurring Hebrew/Greek concepts within a book
- Keep proper nouns and place names as-is (e.g., "Jerusalem" stays "Jerusalem")
- Standard terms: LORD (all caps when representing YHWH), God, Christ, Holy Spirit

### 5. No Added Commentary
- The CT is a translation, not a study Bible
- Do not insert explanatory notes into the verse text
- If a KJV phrase is genuinely ambiguous, choose the most widely accepted reading

## Formatting Rules

- Preserve verse numbers exactly as in KJV
- Do not merge or split verses
- Do not add section headings or subtitles (the app handles that)
- Quotation marks: use modern double quotes for speech
- Numbers: spell out one through ten; use digits for 11+

## Examples

### Genesis 1:1
- **KJV:** In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
- **CT:** In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

### Genesis 1:2
- **KJV:** And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
- **CT:** The earth had no shape and was empty. Darkness covered the deep waters, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water.

### John 3:16
- **KJV:** For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
- **CT:** For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not be lost but will have eternal life.

### Psalm 23:1
- **KJV:** The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
- **CT:** The LORD is my shepherd. I have everything I need.

### Romans 8:28
- **KJV:** And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
- **CT:** And we know that God works all things together for the good of those who love him — those he has called according to his purpose.

## Words to Modernize

| KJV Term | CT Replacement |
|----------|---------------|
| thee, thou, thy, thine | you, your, yours |
| hath, hast | has, have |
| doth, dost | does, do |
| saith | says, said |
| begat | became the father of |
| unto | to |
| thereof | of it |
| wherefore | therefore / that is why |
| verily | truly |
| cometh | comes |
| goeth | goes |
| shalt | will / shall |
| wilt | will |
| whoso, whosoever | whoever |
| brethren | brothers (or brothers and sisters, when contextually appropriate) |
| raiment | clothing |
| behold | look / see / pay attention |
| lo | look / see |
| hearken | listen |
| abode | stayed / lived |
| wroth | angry |
| smote | struck |
| spake | spoke |
| nigh | near |

## Protected Terms — DO NOT Change These

Some KJV terms carry specific theological weight and must be preserved in the CT.
Do NOT replace them with simpler synonyms.

| KJV Term | Rule |
|----------|------|
| heaven / heavens | Keep as-is. Do NOT change to "sky." |
| created | Keep when KJV uses "created." Do NOT swap to "made" or "formed." Hebrew "bara" is reserved for God's creative acts. |
| soul | Keep as "soul." Do NOT change to "life" unless context clearly means physical life. |
| spirit | Keep as "spirit." Do NOT change to "breath" unless context clearly means physical breath. |
| grace | Keep as "grace." |
| righteousness | Keep as "righteousness." |
| salvation | Keep as "salvation." |
| covenant | Keep as "covenant." |
| sin | Keep as "sin." |
| atonement | Keep as "atonement." |
| glory | Keep as "glory." |
| God, LORD, Lord GOD, the Almighty | Keep exactly as written. |

## Tone Guidelines

The CT should sound **clear and dignified** — like a trusted friend explaining Scripture, not a professor lecturing or a teenager texting.

- **Too formal:** "Let luminaries appear in the expanse" → Use "lights" instead
- **Too casual:** "pack the water in the seas" → Use "fill the waters" instead
- **Just right:** "Let lights appear in the expanse of the heavens"

Do NOT add words that aren't in the original:
- **Bad:** "Instantly, light existed" (adds "instantly" — not in original)
- **Good:** "And light appeared" (clean, simple, faithful)

When the original repeats a word for emphasis, preserve the repetition:
- **KJV:** "So God created man... in the image of God created he him... male and female created he them"
- **CT:** "So God created human beings... in the image of God he created them... male and female he created them"
