# Clear Translation (CT) — Style Guide

## Purpose

The Clear Translation (CT) is a modern-English rendering of the Bible
designed for BibleSummary.ai. It sits alongside the King James Version (KJV) to
give readers an accessible, fully understandable entry point to Scripture.

The goal is not to change what the Bible says — it is to make sure every reader
can understand exactly what it means.

## Core Principles

### 1. Faithful to Meaning
- Convey the same meaning as the original text
- Do not add theological interpretation or commentary
- Do not remove or skip content — every verse must be represented
- Preserve the verse-by-verse structure (same verse numbers as KJV)
- Precision matters: "urge" ≠ "force," "full" ≠ "everything"

### 2. Modern English (10th Grade Reading Level)
- Write the way a thoughtful person speaks today — clear, natural, and direct
- The text should flow like a story being told, not like a religious recitation
- Think of it as telling the story to a smart teenager who has never read the Bible
- When something cultural or historical would confuse a modern reader, find the clearest modern equivalent phrasing
- No archaic language whatsoever

### 3. Natural Sentence Structure
- Break long KJV compound sentences into shorter ones when it helps readability
- Dialogue should sound like real people talking, not formal proclamations
- Avoid both overly casual AND overly formal language — aim for the middle ground
- Remove "And" from the beginning of sentences when it's just a connector

### 4. Consistent Terminology
- Use the same English word for recurring concepts within a book
- Keep proper nouns and place names as-is
- Standard terms: LORD (all caps when representing YHWH), God, Christ, Holy Spirit

### 5. No Added Commentary
- The CT is a translation, not a study Bible
- Do not insert explanatory notes into the verse text
- Do not add adverbs, interpretations, or dramatic flair

## Formatting Rules

- Preserve verse numbers exactly as in KJV
- Do not merge or split verses
- Do not add section headings or subtitles (the app handles that)
- Quotation marks: double quotes for direct speech, single quotes for speech within speech
- Numbers: ALWAYS use numerals — write "14" not "fourteen," "40" not "forty," "969" not "nine hundred and sixty-nine"
- Convert ancient measurements to modern equivalents where helpful (cubits to feet)

## Protected Terms — DO NOT Change These

Some KJV terms carry specific theological weight and must be preserved in the CT.

| KJV Term | Rule |
|----------|------|
| heaven / heavens | Keep as-is. Do NOT change to "sky." |
| created | Keep when KJV uses "created." Do NOT swap to "made" or "formed." |
| soul | Keep as "soul." Do NOT change to "life" unless context clearly means physical life. |
| spirit | Keep as "spirit." Do NOT change to "breath" unless context clearly means physical breath. |
| grace | Keep as "grace." |
| righteousness | Keep as "righteousness." |
| salvation | Keep as "salvation." |
| covenant | Keep as "covenant." |
| sin | Keep as "sin." |
| atonement | Keep as "atonement." |
| glory | Keep as "glory." |
| God, LORD, Lord GOD, the Almighty | Keep exactly as written. |

## Tone Guidelines

The CT should sound **clear and dignified** — like a trusted friend explaining Scripture, not a professor lecturing or a teenager texting.

- **Too formal:** "Let luminaries appear in the expanse" → Use "lights" instead
- **Too casual:** "pack the water in the seas" → Use "fill the waters" instead
- **Just right:** "Let lights appear in the expanse of the heavens"

Do NOT add words that aren't in the original:
- **Bad:** "Instantly, light existed" (adds "instantly" — not in original)
- **Good:** "And light appeared" (clean, simple, faithful)

When the original repeats a word for emphasis, preserve the repetition:
- **KJV:** "So God created man... in the image of God created he him... male and female created he them"
- **CT:** "So God created human beings... in the image of God he created them... male and female he created them"

## Examples

### BAD → GOOD Comparisons

| BAD (Don't write this) | GOOD (Write this) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| And it came to pass that Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there. | So Abram traveled down to Egypt to live there for a while. |
| And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. | He struck them down completely and defeated them. |
| And Leah conceived and bare a son. | Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. |
| Threescore and ten years. | 70 years. |
| He delivered mine enemies into mine hand. | He gave me victory over my enemies. |
| And Adam knew Eve his wife. | Adam had relations with his wife Eve. |
| Turn not thy face from me, O LORD. | Don't withdraw your favor from me, LORD. |
| The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. | Reverence for the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. |
| Noah was a just man, and one that feared God. | Noah was a good man who feared God. |
