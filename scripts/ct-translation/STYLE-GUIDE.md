# Clear Translation (CT) — Style Guide

## Purpose

The Clear Translation (CT) modernizes the King James Version's grammar and archaic vocabulary so any reader today can understand it. It sits alongside the KJV in BibleSummary.ai to give readers an accessible entry point to Scripture.

**The goal is not to change what the Bible says — it is to make sure every reader can understand the language it's written in.**

## Core Principle

Modernize ONLY the grammar and archaic vocabulary. Never change nouns, names, creatures, materials, places, or theological terms. If the KJV says it, the CT keeps it — just in modern sentence structure.

## Rules

### 1. Never Add
No words, adjectives, titles, qualifiers, or explanatory phrases not in the KJV. If it is not in the KJV, it must not be in the CT.

### 2. Never Omit
Every KJV word, phrase, and clause must have a counterpart in the CT. Do not compress, summarize, or skip anything.

### 3. Never Interpret
Translate literally. "Hornet" stays "hornet." "Circumcise your heart" stays as-is. "A hill" stays "a hill." Directional language stays literal.

### 4. Never Sanitize
Keep graphic, vivid, or uncomfortable content exactly as the KJV has it.

### 5. Never Change Pronoun Number
"He" stays "he." "Him" stays "him." Singular stays singular, plural stays plural.

### 6. Never Narrow or Broaden Scope
"That which toucheth" → "whatever touches," not "anyone who touches."

### 7. Keep All KJV Nouns Exactly
Every specific noun the KJV uses stays — animals, materials, terms, theological words, descriptions. Do NOT substitute modern alternatives.

### 8. Preserve Emphasis & Patterns
Keep word repetition for emphasis. Preserve poetic contrasts and specific idioms exactly.

## Formatting Rules

- Numbers: ALWAYS use numerals (40, not "forty")
- Units: Keep KJV units — cubits, shekels, ephahs. Do NOT convert.
- Verse structure: One verse in = one verse out. Never merge or split.
- Quotation marks: double for direct speech, single for speech-within-speech
- Remove connector "And" at sentence starts; keep when meaningful
- Proper nouns unchanged

## Tone

Clear and dignified — like a trusted friend explaining what the KJV says in today's language. Not academic, not casual. A smart 16-year-old should understand every sentence immediately.
