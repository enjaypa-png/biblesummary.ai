# Clear Translation (CT) Audit Rules

## MODERNIZATION + MEANING LOCK RULES (MANDATORY)

Rewrite each verse in clear, natural modern English at approximately a 10th-grade reading level.

Modernize archaic grammar, outdated sentence structure, and obsolete expressions. The wording must sound natural to a modern reader and flow smoothly.

- You may change form.
- You may not change meaning.

Preserve the exact intent, relational depth, emotional weight, and covenant meaning of the King James Version text.

---

## ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS

Do NOT:
- Add comparisons not present in the text
- Add psychological explanations
- Add romantic implications
- Add symbolic interpretations
- Add clarifying motive statements
- Soften strong language
- Intensify neutral language
- Insert modern categories not explicitly stated
- Remove theological force
- Reduce emotional depth
- Expand imagery beyond what is written

Change wording only — never change meaning, tone, intensity, or implication.

If even a slight meaning shift occurs, mark the verse FAIL.

## EXAMPLES

**KJV:** "The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David."

✅ Acceptable: "Jonathan formed a deep bond with David."

❌ Not Acceptable: "Jonathan fell in love with David." (Adds romantic meaning)

❌ Not Acceptable: "Jonathan and David loved each other like brothers." (Adds comparison not in text)

❌ Not Acceptable: "Jonathan admired David's success." (Changes emotional meaning)

---

**KJV:** "And it came to pass…"

✅ Acceptable: "After this…" or "Later…"

❌ Not Acceptable: "At this symbolic turning point…" (Adds interpretation)

---

**KJV:** "And he went in unto her."

✅ Acceptable: "He slept with her."

❌ Not Acceptable: "He began a romantic relationship with her." (Adds interpretation and softens meaning)

## MEANING LOCK VERIFICATION (MANDATORY SELF-CHECK)

After rewriting each verse, verify:
1. The original KJV verse
2. The modernized verse produced

Compare them carefully:
- No meaning was added
- No meaning was removed
- No emotional intensity was altered
- No implication was introduced
- No interpretive category was inserted
- No motive was inferred

If any difference in meaning, tone, intensity, or implication is detected — even slightly — the verse must be marked FAIL and rewritten.

The modernized verse must pass a strict semantic equivalence test against the KJV.

**Only wording may change. Meaning must remain identical.**

When in doubt between clarity and precision, choose precision.
