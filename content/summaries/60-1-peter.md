# 1 Peter

## 1–2: Living as God's people

Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, writes to the believers scattered throughout various regions, identifying them as elect according to God's foreknowledge. He blesses God for giving them a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, an incorruptible inheritance reserved in heaven. Though they face various trials, their faith is being tested and proven genuine, which will result in praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Peter calls them to be holy in all their conduct, just as God who called them is holy, reminding them that they were redeemed not with silver or gold but with the precious blood of Christ. Having been born again through the living and abiding word of God, they are to love one another earnestly from a pure heart.

As newborn babes, they are to desire the pure milk of the word to grow thereby. They are a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, built on Christ, the living stone. Peter describes them as a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and His own special people, called out of darkness into His marvelous light. He urges them, as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts and to have honorable conduct among the Gentiles. He instructs them to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king or to governors. They are to honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, and honor the king. Servants are instructed to be submissive to their masters, enduring suffering wrongfully for conscience toward God, following the example of Christ, who suffered for them, leaving an example that they should follow His steps.

## 3–4: Suffering for doing good

Peter provides instructions for wives to be submissive to their own husbands, so that even those who do not obey the word may be won over by their conduct. Their adornment should not be merely outward but should be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit. Husbands are to dwell with their wives with understanding, giving honor to them as the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life. All believers are called to be of one mind, having compassion for one another, loving as brothers, being tenderhearted, and courteous, not returning evil for evil but, on the contrary, blessing. They should be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks them a reason for the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear. It is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God.

Since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, believers should arm themselves with the same mind, to live the rest of their time not for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. The end of all things is at hand; therefore, they should be serious and watchful in their prayers and have fervent love for one another, for love will cover a multitude of sins. They are to be hospitable and minister to one another with the gifts they have received. Peter encourages them not to think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try them, but to rejoice to the extent that they partake of Christ's sufferings. If they are reproached for the name of Christ, they are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon them. However, they should not suffer as a murderer, thief, evildoer, or busybody. If they suffer as a Christian, they should not be ashamed, but should glorify God. Judgment must begin at the house of God, and those who suffer according to the will of God should commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.

## 5: Instructions for elders

Peter exhorts the elders to shepherd the flock of God, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; not as being lords over those entrusted to them, but being examples to the flock. When the Chief Shepherd appears, they will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away. Likewise, the younger people are to submit to the elders. All believers are to be submissive to one another and be clothed with humility, for "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." Therefore, they should humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt them in due time, casting all their care upon Him, for He cares for them. They must be sober and vigilant because their adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. They are to resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by their brotherhood in the world. After they have suffered a while, the God of all grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle them. The epistle concludes with a final greeting and a blessing of peace.
