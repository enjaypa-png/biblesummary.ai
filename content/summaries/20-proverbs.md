## Proverbs 1: The Beginning of Knowledge

These are the proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. They are given to know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, and to receive instruction in wise behavior, justice, judgment, and fairness. They are written to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young. A wise person hears and increases learning, and a person of understanding gains wise counsel. The fear of the LORD is stated as the beginning of knowledge, while fools despise wisdom and instruction.

Solomon urges his son to hear his father's instruction and not forsake his mother's teaching. He warns him not to consent when sinners entice him to join in violence, robbery, and bloodshed. He describes them lying in wait for innocent people and promising stolen wealth. He says such paths lead to their own destruction. Wisdom is then personified as calling out in the streets, rebuking the simple, scorners, and fools for refusing correction. She warns that because they reject her counsel, calamity will come and they will call for help but not be answered. Those who listen to her dwell safely and are free from fear of evil.

## Proverbs 2: The Value of Wisdom

Solomon tells his son to receive his words, treasure his commandments, and seek wisdom as one searches for silver and hidden treasure. He says that by doing this, the son will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. The LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding. He stores up sound wisdom for the upright and guards the path of justice, preserving the way of His saints.

Wisdom enters the heart and delivers a person from the way of evil men who speak twisted things and leave upright paths. These men rejoice in doing evil and delight in wrongdoing. Wisdom also delivers from the strange woman who flatters with her words and forsakes the guide of her youth. Her house leads down to death, and those who go to her do not return. The upright dwell in the land, but the wicked are cut off.

## Proverbs 3: Trust in the LORD

Solomon urges his son not to forget his law but to keep his commandments in his heart, promising long life and peace. He calls for mercy and truth to be bound around the neck and written on the heart. He instructs him to trust in the LORD with all his heart and not lean on his own understanding, promising that the LORD will direct his paths. He warns against being wise in one's own eyes and urges turning away from evil.

He describes the blessing of honoring the LORD with one's possessions, saying that barns will be filled. He tells his son not to despise the LORD's correction, for the LORD corrects those He loves. Wisdom is described as more valuable than silver and gold. By wisdom the LORD founded the earth. Solomon advises not withholding good when it is in one's power, not planning evil against a neighbor, and not envying violent men. The upright dwell securely under the LORD's blessing, while the wicked are cursed.

## Proverbs 4: Get Wisdom

Solomon calls his sons to hear a father's instruction. He recalls how his own father taught him to keep commandments and live. He urges them to get wisdom and understanding and not forget his words. Wisdom is to be exalted and embraced, and she will honor those who love her. The path of the just shines brighter and brighter, while the way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.

He tells his son to attend to his words and keep them in the heart, for they are life and health. He instructs him to guard his heart, for out of it come the issues of life. He warns against a deceitful mouth and urges looking straight ahead, pondering the path of the feet, and not turning to the right or left. He commands him to remove his foot from evil.

## Proverbs 5: Warning Against Adultery

Solomon calls his son to pay attention to wisdom and discretion. He warns about the strange woman whose lips drip honey but whose end is bitter and whose steps lead to death. He tells his son to stay far from her house and not give his honor and strength to others. He describes regret that comes when a person despises instruction and finds himself consumed by others.

He urges his son to rejoice with the wife of his youth and be satisfied with her love. He warns against being captivated by an adulteress. The ways of a person are before the eyes of the LORD, and He considers all paths. The wicked are held by their own sins and die for lack of instruction.

## Proverbs 6: Practical Warnings

Solomon warns against becoming surety for a neighbor and pledging for a stranger. He urges immediate action to free oneself from such a trap. He points to the ant as an example of diligence, storing food in summer. He describes a lazy person who sleeps and folds his hands until poverty comes suddenly. He lists traits of a worthless person who speaks perversely and devises evil.

He declares six things the LORD hates, even seven: proud eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run to mischief, a false witness, and one who sows discord. He again urges keeping his father's commandment and warns about the evil woman. He says adultery reduces a man to a piece of bread and brings destruction, while jealousy provokes fierce anger.

## Proverbs 7: The Seductress

Solomon urges his son to keep his commandments and treasure them, writing them on the heart. He says wisdom should be treated as a sister and understanding as a close relative, to keep him from the strange woman. He describes watching from his window and seeing a simple young man lacking understanding.

He tells how the woman meets him with bold speech and seductive words, describing her prepared bed and her husband being away. She persuades him, and he follows her like an ox going to slaughter. Solomon says her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.

## Proverbs 8: Wisdom's Call

Wisdom is personified and calls out in public places, inviting the simple to learn understanding. She says she speaks noble things and hates wickedness. Her words are right and true. She offers counsel, strength, riches, and righteousness. Kings reign and princes rule by her. She loves those who love her and is found by those who seek her.

Wisdom declares that the LORD possessed her in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. She describes being present when the heavens and earth were established. She rejoices before Him and delights in the sons of men. She calls people to listen, saying those who find her find life, but those who hate her love death.

## Proverbs 9: Wisdom and Folly

Wisdom is depicted as building her house and preparing a feast. She sends out maidens to call the simple to leave foolishness and live. She invites them to eat her bread and drink her wine. The chapter contrasts responses to correction: a scorner hates rebuke, but a wise person loves it.

Folly is also personified as a loud and simple woman who sits at her door and calls to those who pass by. She invites the simple to stolen waters and secret bread, claiming they are sweet. Those who respond do not know that the dead are there and her guests are in the depths of hell.

## Proverbs 10: Contrasts of Wisdom and Folly

These are the proverbs of Solomon. He contrasts a wise son who makes a glad father with a foolish son who brings grief to his mother. Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death. The LORD does not allow the righteous to hunger but rejects the desire of the wicked.

He contrasts diligent hands with lazy hands, wise speech with foolish talk, and integrity with crooked ways. The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, while the mouth of the wicked hides violence. Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all sins. The fear of the LORD prolongs days, but the years of the wicked are shortened.

## Proverbs 11: Righteousness and Wickedness

A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is His delight. Pride brings shame, but humility brings wisdom. The integrity of the upright guides them, while the perverseness of transgressors destroys them. Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.

The righteous are delivered out of trouble, and the wicked come in their place. A gracious woman retains honor, and strong men retain riches. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and the one who wins souls is wise. The chapter concludes that the righteous are rewarded in the earth, much more the wicked and the sinner.

## Proverbs 12: Words and Deeds

Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge, but one who hates correction is foolish. A good person obtains favor from the LORD, but a man of wicked devices is condemned. A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, but one who causes shame is like rottenness in his bones.

The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful. A lying tongue is an abomination to the LORD, but those who deal truly are His delight. The diligent are made rich, but the lazy become subject to tribute. The righteous person regards the life of his animal, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

## Proverbs 13: Wise Living

A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scorner does not listen to rebuke. A person eats good by the fruit of his mouth, but the soul of the transgressors eats violence. He who keeps his mouth preserves his soul, but one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.

The righteous hates lying, but the wicked brings shame. Wealth gained quickly diminishes, but gathered little by little it increases. Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when desire comes, it is a tree of life. The one who walks with wise men becomes wise, but a companion of fools is destroyed.

## Proverbs 14: The Wise Woman and the Fool

Every wise woman builds her house, but the foolish tears it down. The one who walks in uprightness fears the LORD, but the perverse despises Him. A soft answer and careful speech contrast with foolish words that bring trouble.

The house of the wicked is overthrown, but the tent of the upright flourishes. There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death. The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life. Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

## Proverbs 15: A Soft Answer

A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger. The tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly, but the mouth of fools pours out foolishness. The eyes of the LORD are in every place, watching the evil and the good.

A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, but the prayer of the upright is His delight. Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure with trouble. The fear of the LORD is instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor.

## Proverbs 16: The LORD Directs the Heart

The preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD. All the ways of a person are clean in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirits. Committing works to the LORD leads to established thoughts.

Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Pleasant words are like honeycomb, sweet to the soul and health to the bones. There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is death. The gray head is a crown of glory if found in the way of righteousness.

## Proverbs 17: Matters of the Heart

Better is a dry morsel with quietness than a house full of sacrifices with strife. The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, but the LORD tests hearts. A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

A merry heart does good like medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones. The one who justifies the wicked and the one who condemns the just are both an abomination. The beginning of strife is like letting out water, so contention should be stopped before it begins.

## Proverbs 18: The Power of Words

Through desire a person separates himself and seeks his own desire. A fool does not delight in understanding but in expressing his own heart. The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe.

The one who answers a matter before hearing it is foolish. The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it eat its fruit. He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD. A person with many friends may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

## Proverbs 19: Better Poor and Upright

Better is the poor who walks in integrity than one who is perverse in speech and foolish. Wealth makes many friends, but the poor is separated from his neighbor. A false witness is not unpunished and does not escape.

He who has pity on the poor lends to the LORD, and He repays him. A foolish son is the calamity of his father. House and riches are inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD. The fear of the LORD leads to life and rest.

## Proverbs 20: Wine and Wisdom

Wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging, and whoever is deceived by it is not wise. The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion. It is honorable to cease from strife, but every fool meddles.

Bread gained by deceit is sweet at first, but afterward the mouth is filled with gravel. A person's steps are from the LORD; how can one understand his own way? Even a child is known by his actions. The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching the inward parts.

## Proverbs 21: The King's Heart

The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, and He turns it wherever He wills. Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the hearts. To do justice and judgment is more acceptable than sacrifice.

The one who pursues righteousness and mercy finds life, righteousness, and honor. The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but safety belongs to the LORD. The wicked person's way is crooked, but the pure person's work is right.

## Proverbs 22: A Good Name

A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches. The rich and poor meet together; the LORD is the maker of them all. A prudent person foresees evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished.

Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. The borrower is servant to the lender. He who sows iniquity reaps trouble. Do not remove the ancient landmark. The chapter ends by describing a diligent person standing before kings.

## Proverbs 23: Warnings and Counsel

Solomon warns about eating with a ruler and being careful of appetite. He says not to labor to be rich and warns about riches flying away like an eagle. He cautions against moving ancient boundaries and entering fields of the fatherless.

## Proverbs 24: Do Not Envy Evil Men

Solomon warns not to envy evil men or desire their company. Through wisdom a house is built and established by understanding. He says a wise person is strong and that counsel is needed for war.

He warns against rejoicing when an enemy falls. If one fails in adversity, strength is small. He commands delivering those drawn to death. He speaks of the sluggard's field overgrown with thorns and concludes that poverty comes on such a person like a robber.

## Proverbs 25: More Proverbs of Solomon

These are also proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah. It is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to search it out. Removing wicked people from before a king establishes his throne in righteousness.

A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. Like cold snow in harvest is a faithful messenger. He warns against boasting of gifts not given and describes kindness to an enemy by giving him food and drink.

## Proverbs 26: Fools and Sluggards

As snow in summer is not fitting, so honor is not fitting for a fool. A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the fool's back. He gives guidance on answering a fool according to his folly so that he does not seem wise.

The sluggard says there is a lion in the way and turns in bed like a door on its hinges. A talebearer's words are like wounds. Burning lips and a wicked heart are compared to a potsherd covered with silver dross. The chapter ends warning about hidden hatred and deceit.

## Proverbs 27: Friends and Folly

Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day brings. Let another praise you and not your own mouth. Open rebuke is better than secret love.

Iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens another. A faithful friend wounds, but an enemy multiplies kisses. The chapter compares various conditions of life and urges knowing the state of one's flocks and herds.

## Proverbs 28: The Righteous and the Wicked

The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion. Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law contend with them. Better is the poor who walks in integrity than one perverse in ways.

He who covers his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. A ruler lacking understanding oppresses, but one who hates covetousness prolongs his days. The one who gives to the poor does not lack.

## Proverbs 29: Authority and Correction

He who is often reproved and hardens his neck is suddenly destroyed. When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people mourn. The king who judges faithfully establishes the land.

The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe. Where there is no vision, the people perish, but the one who keeps the law is happy. A servant is not corrected by words alone. The chapter ends contrasting pride and humility.

## Proverbs 30: The Words of Agur

These are the words of Agur the son of Jakeh. He speaks of his limited understanding and asks who has ascended into heaven or gathered the wind. He declares that every word of God is pure and warns not to add to His words.

Agur asks for two things: to remove falsehood and to give neither poverty nor riches but daily food. He lists generations marked by pride and greed. He speaks of things that are never satisfied and of small creatures that are wise. He concludes by warning against exalting oneself and stirring up anger.

## Proverbs 31: The Virtuous Woman

These are the words of King Lemuel, the prophecy his mother teaches him. She warns him not to give his strength to women or his ways to that which destroys kings. She tells him that kings should not drink wine lest they forget the law and pervert judgment. She urges him to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves and to judge righteously.

The chapter describes a virtuous woman. She is trustworthy and brings good to her husband. She works willingly with her hands, provides food, considers a field and buys it, and plants a vineyard. She stretches out her hand to the poor and is clothed with strength and honor. Her husband is known in the gates. Her children rise up and call her blessed, and her husband praises her. She fears the LORD and is praised for her works.
