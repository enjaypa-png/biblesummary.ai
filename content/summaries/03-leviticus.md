# Leviticus

## Leviticus 1: The Burnt Offering
The LORD calls to Moses from the tabernacle and gives instructions for the burnt offering. A man who brings a burnt offering from the herd presents a male without blemish at the door of the tabernacle. He lays his hand on the head of the offering, kills it, and Aaron's sons the priests sprinkle the blood around the altar. The animal is flayed and cut into pieces, and the whole is burned on the altar as a sweet savor to the LORD.

If the offering is from the flock, whether sheep or goats, it must also be a male without blemish, killed on the north side of the altar, with blood sprinkled and the whole burned. If the offering is of birds, turtledoves or young pigeons are brought; the priest wrings off the head, removes the crop with its feathers, and burns it on the altar.

## Leviticus 2: The Meat Offering
The meat offering consists of fine flour with oil and frankincense. The priest takes a handful as a memorial and burns it on the altar; the rest belongs to Aaron and his sons and is most holy. If the offering is baked in an oven, pan, or frying pan, it must be unleavened and mingled with oil. It is broken in pieces and oil poured on it.

No leaven or honey is burned on the altar, but every meat offering must be seasoned with salt. The offering of firstfruits may be presented, including green ears of corn dried by fire, with oil and frankincense placed on it.

## Leviticus 3: The Peace Offering
The peace offering may be from the herd or flock, male or female, without blemish. The offerer lays his hand on the head and kills it at the door of the tabernacle. The priests sprinkle the blood on the altar. The fat that covers the inward parts, the kidneys, and the caul above the liver are burned as a sweet savor.

If the offering is a lamb or a goat, the same parts are burned. The LORD declares that all the fat is his and commands that the children of Israel eat neither fat nor blood in any of their dwellings.

## Leviticus 4: The Sin Offering
The LORD gives instructions for the sin offering when someone sins through ignorance. If the priest that is anointed sins, he brings a young bullock without blemish. He lays his hand on its head, kills it, and the blood is brought into the tabernacle and sprinkled before the LORD. The fat is burned on the altar, and the rest of the bullock is burned outside the camp.

If the whole congregation sins, they bring a young bullock with similar procedures. If a ruler sins, he brings a male goat; if one of the common people sins, he brings a female goat or lamb. In each case, the priest makes an atonement, and it is forgiven.

## Leviticus 5: The Trespass Offering
The LORD describes cases where a person is guilty, such as refusing to testify, touching unclean things, or swearing rashly. When he realizes his guilt, he confesses and brings a female from the flock as a sin offering. If he cannot afford that, he brings two turtledoves or two young pigeons; if he cannot afford birds, he brings fine flour without oil or frankincense.

The chapter also describes the trespass offering for sins in the holy things of the LORD. The offender brings a ram without blemish and makes restitution with an added fifth part. The priest makes atonement for him.

## Leviticus 6: Laws of Offerings
The LORD gives more instructions about the trespass offering when a person lies, steals, or deceives his neighbor. He restores what he took, adds a fifth part, and brings a ram for a trespass offering. The priest makes atonement for him.

The law of the burnt offering is given: the fire on the altar must burn continually and not go out. The priest removes the ashes and lays them beside the altar. The law of the meat offering is also given, including the daily offering of Aaron and his sons, half in the morning and half at night.

## Leviticus 7: Laws of the Peace Offering
The law of the trespass offering and the peace offering is explained further. The priest who offers the burnt offering receives the skin of the burnt offering. The meat offering belongs to the priest who offers it.

The peace offering may be for thanksgiving, a vow, or a freewill offering. It must be eaten on the same day or the next, depending on the type. The fat and blood must not be eaten. The breast and right shoulder are given to Aaron and his sons as their portion from the offerings of the LORD.

## Leviticus 8: The Consecration of the Priests
Moses gathers the congregation at the door of the tabernacle as the LORD commands. He washes Aaron and his sons with water and clothes Aaron with the holy garments, anointing the tabernacle and the altar with oil. He pours the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anoints him.

Aaron's sons are clothed and ordained. Moses offers a sin offering, a burnt offering, and a ram of consecration. He puts blood on Aaron's right ear, thumb, and toe, and on his sons in the same way. They remain at the door of the tabernacle seven days as commanded.

## Leviticus 9: The Priests Begin Their Ministry
On the eighth day, Moses tells Aaron to offer a sin offering and burnt offering for himself and for the people. Aaron presents the offerings as commanded. He blesses the people after offering the sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offerings.

Moses and Aaron enter the tabernacle and come out and bless the people. The glory of the LORD appears to all the people, and fire comes out from before the LORD and consumes the burnt offering on the altar. The people shout and fall on their faces.

## Leviticus 10: Nadab and Abihu
Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, take their censers and offer strange fire before the LORD, which he commands not. Fire goes out from the LORD and devours them, and they die before the LORD. Moses tells Aaron that the LORD will be sanctified in those who come near him, and Aaron holds his peace.

Moses instructs Mishael and Elzaphan to carry Nadab and Abihu outside the camp. Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, are told not to mourn publicly. The LORD commands that priests must not drink wine or strong drink when entering the tabernacle. Moses later questions why the sin offering is not eaten, and Aaron explains his reasoning; Moses is content.

## Leviticus 11: Clean and Unclean Animals
The LORD speaks to Moses and Aaron about clean and unclean animals. Animals that divide the hoof and chew the cud may be eaten; others, such as the camel and swine, are unclean. Of the waters, creatures with fins and scales may be eaten; others are unclean.

Certain birds are listed as unclean. Of creeping things, some locusts may be eaten, but most creeping things are unclean. Touching their carcasses makes a person unclean until evening. The LORD commands Israel to be holy and to distinguish between clean and unclean.

## Leviticus 12: Purification After Childbirth
The LORD gives laws concerning childbirth. A woman who bears a male child is unclean seven days and continues in the blood of her purifying thirty-three days. If she bears a female child, she is unclean two weeks and continues sixty-six days.

When the days are fulfilled, she brings a lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering. If she cannot afford a lamb, she brings two birds. The priest makes atonement for her.

## Leviticus 13: Laws About Leprosy
The LORD gives Moses and Aaron detailed laws about leprosy in a person. When a swelling, scab, or bright spot appears, the priest examines it and may shut the person up seven days to observe it. If the plague spreads or meets certain conditions, the person is declared unclean.

Laws are also given for leprosy in garments of wool, linen, or leather. The priest examines the garment, and if the plague spreads, it is burned; if not, it may be washed and reexamined.

## Leviticus 14: Cleansing of Leprosy
The LORD describes the cleansing of a leper. The priest goes outside the camp and examines him. Two birds are taken; one is killed over running water, and the other is dipped in the blood and released. The cleansed person washes, shaves, and waits seven days.

On the eighth day, he brings offerings, including a trespass offering, sin offering, and burnt offering. The priest places blood and oil on his right ear, thumb, and toe. Instructions are also given for leprosy in a house; if stones are infected, they are removed, and if the plague spreads, the house may be broken down.

## Leviticus 15: Laws About Bodily Discharges
The LORD gives laws about bodily discharges. A man with an issue is unclean, and anything he touches becomes unclean. When he is cleansed, he washes and brings two birds for offerings.

If a man has an emission of seed, he washes and is unclean until evening. A woman in her monthly period is unclean seven days, and anything she touches is unclean. If she has an issue of blood beyond her period, she follows similar rules and brings offerings when cleansed.

## Leviticus 16: The Day of Atonement
The LORD speaks to Moses after the death of Nadab and Abihu and gives instructions for the Day of Atonement. Aaron must not enter the holy place at all times but only with a sin offering and burnt offering. He puts on holy linen garments and offers a bullock for himself and his house.

Two goats are taken for the people; lots are cast, one for the LORD and one for the scapegoat. The goat for the LORD is offered as a sin offering, and its blood is brought within the veil. Aaron lays both hands on the head of the live goat, confesses over it the iniquities of Israel, and sends it away into the wilderness. This statute is to be observed once a year.

## Leviticus 17: The Sanctity of Blood
The LORD commands that any ox, lamb, or goat killed must be brought to the door of the tabernacle as an offering; otherwise, blood is imputed to that man. The people must not offer sacrifices to devils.

The LORD forbids eating blood. Anyone who eats blood is cut off. Hunters who take an animal or fowl must pour out its blood and cover it with dust. Anyone who eats what dies of itself must wash and be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 18: Unlawful Sexual Relations
The LORD commands Israel not to follow the practices of Egypt or Canaan. He gives laws against uncovering nakedness among close relatives, including parents, siblings, grandchildren, aunts, daughters-in-law, and others.

He forbids lying with a woman during her period, adultery, passing children through the fire to Molech, lying with mankind as with womankind, and bestiality. The land is described as defiled by these practices, and Israel is warned not to commit them.

## Leviticus 19: Laws of Holiness
The LORD commands Israel to be holy. He gives various laws: honoring father and mother, keeping sabbaths, avoiding idols, and proper conduct in offerings. He instructs leaving gleanings for the poor and the stranger.

He forbids stealing, lying, oppressing a neighbor, and defrauding a hired servant. He commands just judgment, forbids hatred in the heart, and says to love a neighbor as oneself. Laws about mixtures, sexual conduct, and reverence for the sanctuary are included.

## Leviticus 20: Penalties for Sin
The LORD states penalties for certain sins. Anyone who gives his seed to Molech is put to death. Those who turn to familiar spirits are cut off. Various sexual sins listed earlier carry the penalty of death or being cut off.

The LORD calls Israel to be holy and separate from other people. He commands them to distinguish between clean and unclean beasts and birds and warns that those who consult familiar spirits are to be put to death.

## Leviticus 21: Rules for Priests
The LORD gives rules for the priests, the sons of Aaron. A priest must not defile himself for the dead except for close relatives. He must not make baldness on his head or cut his flesh. He must marry a wife who is not profaned.

The high priest must not uncover his head or rend his clothes and must not go in to any dead body. Any priest with a blemish may not offer the bread of his God, though he may eat of it.

## Leviticus 22: Holy Offerings
The LORD instructs Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from holy things when unclean. No stranger may eat of the holy thing, but a priest's household may. A priest's daughter married to a stranger may not eat of holy things.

Offerings must be without blemish. Animals that are blind, broken, or have certain defects are not accepted. The people are commanded not to profane the holy name of the LORD.

## Leviticus 23: The Appointed Feasts
The LORD sets appointed feasts. The sabbath is observed weekly. The Passover and the feast of unleavened bread occur in the first month. The feast of firstfruits is brought after the harvest begins.

The feast of weeks is counted seven sabbaths after firstfruits. In the seventh month are the feast of trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the feast of tabernacles, which lasts seven days, followed by an eighth day of solemn assembly.

## Leviticus 24: The Lamp and the Showbread
The LORD commands that pure oil be brought for the lamps to burn continually in the tabernacle. Twelve cakes of showbread are set in two rows on the pure table before the LORD every sabbath.

A man whose mother is an Israelite and father an Egyptian blasphemes the name of the LORD. He is brought to Moses, and the LORD commands that he be stoned. The law of equal justice is stated: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.

## Leviticus 25: The Sabbath Year and Jubilee
The LORD gives laws for the sabbath year. Every seventh year the land rests; fields are not sown, and vineyards are not pruned. After seven sabbaths of years, the fiftieth year is proclaimed as the jubilee. Liberty is proclaimed, and every man returns to his possession.

Land is not sold forever because it belongs to the LORD. Rules are given for redeeming land and for treating poor brethren kindly. Israelites are not to be sold as bondmen but as hired servants.

## Leviticus 26: Blessings and Curses
The LORD promises blessings for obedience: rain in due season, fruitful land, peace, and victory over enemies. He says he will walk among them and be their God.

He warns of curses for disobedience: terror, disease, famine, defeat, and desolation of the land. If they confess their iniquity, he will remember his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and will not utterly destroy them.

## Leviticus 27: Laws About Vows
The LORD gives laws about vows. When a person makes a vow concerning a person, animals, houses, or fields, values are assigned according to age and kind. If someone wishes to redeem what is vowed, he adds a fifth part.

Firstlings of beasts belong to the LORD and are not vowed. The tithe of the land and of the herd belongs to the LORD. The chapter ends by stating that these are the commandments the LORD commands Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
