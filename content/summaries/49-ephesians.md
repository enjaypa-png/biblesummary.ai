## Ephesians 1: Spiritual Blessings in Christ

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, writes to the saints at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. He declares grace and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. He blesses God for spiritual blessings given in Christ, saying that God chooses believers in Christ before the foundation of the world. He says God predestines them to adoption as children by Jesus Christ and makes known the mystery of His will, gathering all things in Christ in heaven and on earth. He states that believers obtain an inheritance, being predestined according to God's purpose.

Paul explains that those who trust in Christ are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise after hearing the word of truth, the gospel of salvation. He says this Spirit is the earnest of their inheritance until redemption. He gives thanks for their faith and love and prays that God gives them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him. He asks that their understanding be enlightened to know the hope of His calling, the riches of His inheritance, and the exceeding greatness of His power shown in raising Jesus Christ from the dead and setting Him at His own right hand above all principality and power. He says God puts all things under Christ's feet and gives Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body.

## Ephesians 2: Saved by Grace, One in Christ

Paul says believers once walk according to the course of this world and according to the prince of the power of the air. He says they fulfill the desires of the flesh and are by nature children of wrath. He declares that God, who is rich in mercy, makes them alive together with Christ, raises them up together, and seats them in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He says they are saved by grace through faith, not of themselves, not of works, but as the gift of God.

He reminds Gentiles that they are once without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world. He says that now in Christ Jesus those who are far off are made near by the blood of Christ. He states that Christ is their peace, who makes both one and breaks down the middle wall of partition, abolishing enmity and making one new man. He says Christ reconciles both to God in one body by the cross. Through Him both have access by one Spirit to the Father. He declares they are no longer strangers but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone.

## Ephesians 3: The Mystery Revealed to Paul

Paul calls himself the prisoner of Jesus Christ for the Gentiles. He says the dispensation of the grace of God is given to him, and that by revelation the mystery is made known to him. He explains that in other ages this mystery is not made known as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel. He says he becomes a minister according to the gift of God's grace given by the working of His power.

Paul says he preaches among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and makes all see the fellowship of the mystery hidden in God. He states that through the church the manifold wisdom of God is made known to principalities and powers in heavenly places. He asks them not to faint at his tribulations. He bows his knees to the Father and prays that He grants them strength by His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ dwells in their hearts by faith, that they are rooted and grounded in love, and that they comprehend the breadth, length, depth, and height of Christ's love, which passes knowledge.

## Ephesians 4: Unity and the New Man

Paul urges them to walk worthy of their calling, with humility, meekness, longsuffering, and love, keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. He declares there is one body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all. He says grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. He explains that Christ gives apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers for the perfecting of the saints and the edifying of the body of Christ, until all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.

He tells them not to walk as other Gentiles walk, in vanity of mind, being darkened in understanding. He instructs them to put off the old man and to put on the new man, created in righteousness and true holiness. He commands them to put away lying, anger, stealing, corrupt speech, bitterness, wrath, and malice. He tells them to be kind, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake forgives them.

## Ephesians 5: Walk in Love and Wives and Husbands

Paul urges them to be followers of God as dear children and to walk in love, as Christ loves them and gives Himself for them. He commands that fornication, uncleanness, covetousness, filthiness, foolish talking, and jesting not be named among them. He warns that no unclean person or covetous man has inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. He tells them to walk as children of light, proving what is acceptable to the Lord.

He instructs wives to submit to their husbands as unto the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church. He commands husbands to love their wives as Christ loves the church and gives Himself for it. He says a man leaves father and mother and is joined to his wife, and they become one flesh. He speaks concerning Christ and the church and tells each husband to love his wife and each wife to respect her husband.

## Ephesians 6: Children and Parents, Servants and Masters, Armor of God

Paul commands children to obey their parents in the Lord and to honor father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise. He tells fathers not to provoke their children to wrath but to bring them up in instruction. He commands servants to be obedient to their masters with fear and sincerity, as to Christ, and masters to treat servants knowing they also have a Master in heaven.

He tells them to be strong in the Lord and to put on the whole armor of God to stand against the wiles of the devil. He says they wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers. He lists the armor: truth, righteousness, the preparation of the gospel of peace, faith, salvation, and the word of God, and urges prayer at all times. He asks prayer for himself, that he speaks boldly as an ambassador in bonds. He sends Tychicus to make known his affairs and closes with peace, love, faith, and grace to all who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
