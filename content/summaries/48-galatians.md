## Galatians 1: Paul's Apostleship and the True Gospel

Paul identifies himself as an apostle, not sent by men but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead. He addresses the churches of Galatia and speaks of Jesus Christ giving Himself for sins to deliver people from this present evil world. He expresses astonishment that they are turning so quickly to a different gospel. He declares that even if he, or an angel from heaven, preaches another gospel, that one is accursed.

Paul states that the gospel he preaches does not come from man but by revelation of Jesus Christ. He describes his former life in the Jews' religion, how he persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. He explains that God separated him from his mother's womb and called him by grace to reveal His Son in him. After his calling, he does not immediately consult with flesh and blood. He goes into Arabia and later returns to Damascus. After three years, he visits Jerusalem and sees Peter and James the Lord's brother. He later travels into Syria and Cilicia and remains unknown by face to the churches of Judea, though they hear that the one who once persecuted them now preaches the faith he once destroyed.

## Galatians 2: Jerusalem Council and Confronting Peter

After fourteen years, Paul goes again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and takes Titus with him. He goes by revelation and shares the gospel he preaches among the Gentiles. Titus, being a Greek, is not compelled to be circumcised. Paul refuses to yield to false brethren who seek to bring believers into bondage. James, Cephas, and John, who are recognized as pillars, add nothing to his message but give him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that Paul goes to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision.

When Peter comes to Antioch, Paul confronts him publicly because he withdraws from eating with Gentiles out of fear of those from James. Even Barnabas is carried away by this behavior. Paul says that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ. He declares that he is crucified with Christ, yet he lives; Christ lives in him. He does not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ dies in vain.

## Galatians 3: Faith and the Promise to Abraham

Paul calls the Galatians foolish for turning away after Jesus Christ has been clearly presented among them as crucified. He asks whether they receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith. He reminds them of Abraham, who believes God, and it is counted to him for righteousness. Those who are of faith are called the children of Abraham. Scripture announces beforehand that God justifies the heathen through faith.

He states that as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse, because the law requires full obedience. Christ redeems from the curse of the law by being made a curse. The promise to Abraham and his seed is spoken, and that seed is Christ. The law, which comes later, does not cancel the promise. The law serves as a schoolmaster to bring people to Christ, but after faith comes, believers are no longer under a schoolmaster. All who are baptized into Christ put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, male nor female; all are one in Christ Jesus and are Abraham's seed according to the promise.

## Galatians 4: Sons and Heirs, Not Servants

An heir, while a child, differs nothing from a servant though he is lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the appointed time. In the fullness of time, God sends forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem those under the law, so that they receive adoption as sons. Because they are sons, God sends the Spirit of His Son into their hearts, crying, "Abba, Father." They are no longer servants but sons and heirs of God through Christ.

Paul fears for them because they turn again to weak and beggarly elements, observing days and months and times and years. He reminds them how they once receive him despite his infirmity and would have given him their own eyes. He asks if he becomes their enemy by telling them the truth. He speaks of Abraham's two sons, one by a bondwoman and one by a freewoman. These represent two covenants: one from Mount Sinai, which brings bondage, and one which is free. Believers are children of promise as Isaac is.

## Galatians 5: Liberty in Christ and the Fruit of the Spirit

Paul urges them to stand fast in the liberty where Christ makes them free and not be entangled again with bondage. If they receive circumcision, Christ profits them nothing. Whoever seeks to be justified by the law falls from grace. Through the Spirit, believers wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.

He warns that a little leaven leavens the whole lump. They are called to liberty, but not to use liberty as an occasion for the flesh; instead they serve one another by love. The whole law is fulfilled in one word: loving a neighbor as oneself. He lists the works of the flesh, including adultery, idolatry, hatred, and envy. He also lists the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. Those who belong to Christ crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts.

## Galatians 6: Bear One Another's Burdens and Glory in the Cross

If a man is overtaken in a fault, those who are spiritual restore him in a spirit of meekness, considering themselves. Each person bears his own burden and examines his own work. The one taught in the word shares with the one who teaches. God is not mocked; whatever a man sows, that he also reaps. The one who sows to the flesh reaps corruption; the one who sows to the Spirit reaps life everlasting.

Paul writes with his own hand and says that those who desire to make a fair show in the flesh compel others to be circumcised to avoid persecution. They do not keep the law themselves but seek glory in others' flesh. Paul says he will glory only in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to him and he to the world. In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters, but a new creature. He closes with a blessing of grace and peace upon those who walk according to this rule and upon the Israel of God.
