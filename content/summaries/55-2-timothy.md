## 2 Timothy 1: Stir Up the Gift and Do Not Be Ashamed

Paul identifies himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ and writes to Timothy, whom he calls his beloved son. He thanks God and remembers Timothy's sincere faith, which first lives in his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice. Paul urges Timothy to stir up the gift of God given through the laying on of his hands and reminds him that God gives a spirit of power, love, and a sound mind, not fear. He tells Timothy not to be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord or of Paul as a prisoner but to share in suffering for the gospel. Paul says Jesus Christ abolishes death and brings life and immortality to light through the gospel. He urges Timothy to hold fast sound words and guard what is committed to him. He notes that many in Asia turn away, but Onesiphorus often refreshes him and is not ashamed of his chain.

## 2 Timothy 2: Be Strong and Endure Hardship

Paul tells Timothy to be strong in grace and to commit what he learns to faithful men who will teach others. He calls him to endure hardship like a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer. He reminds him that Jesus Christ rises from the dead and says the word of God is not bound. Paul urges Timothy to avoid striving about words and to rightly divide the word of truth. He warns against vain babblings and names Hymenaeus and Philetus, who say the resurrection is past already. He tells Timothy to flee youthful lusts and to follow righteousness, faith, charity, and peace.

## 2 Timothy 3: Perilous Times and the Scriptures

Paul says perilous times come in the last days and lists many sinful behaviors. He says such people have a form of godliness but deny its power. He reminds Timothy of his own persecutions and says all who live godly in Christ Jesus suffer persecution. He urges Timothy to continue in what he learns from the holy scriptures, which are given by inspiration of God and are profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness.

## 2 Timothy 4: Preach the Word and Paul's Final Charge

Paul charges Timothy before God and the Lord Jesus Christ to preach the word and to endure afflictions. He says a time comes when people turn from sound doctrine to fables. Paul declares that his departure is at hand and that he fights a good fight and keeps the faith. He asks Timothy to come quickly, mentions Demas leaving, Luke remaining, and requests Mark, his cloak, and his books. He says the Lord stands with him and delivers him. He sends greetings and closes with grace.
