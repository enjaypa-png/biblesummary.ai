# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1: Charge to Timothy and the Law's Purpose

Paul introduces himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour and the Lord Jesus Christ. He addresses Timothy, calling him his son in the faith. Paul urges Timothy to remain at Ephesus and command certain men not to teach other doctrine or give attention to endless genealogies and fables that produce questions rather than godly building up in faith. He says the goal of the commandment is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith. Some have turned aside into empty talk and desire to be teachers of the law without understanding what they say.

Paul states that the law is good if it is used lawfully. He lists those for whom the law is made, including the lawless, disobedient, ungodly, sinners, the unholy, those who kill fathers or mothers, murderers, immoral persons, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and anything contrary to sound doctrine according to the glorious gospel. He thanks Christ Jesus who strengthens him and appoints him to ministry, though he was formerly a blasphemer and persecutor. He says he receives mercy because he acted in unbelief. He declares that Christ Jesus comes into the world to save sinners, and he calls himself chief among them. He says he receives mercy so that Jesus Christ might show long-suffering in him. He urges Timothy to hold faith and a good conscience, mentioning Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom he delivers to Satan so they may learn not to blaspheme.

## 1 Timothy 2: Prayer for All and Conduct of Men and Women

Paul urges that prayers, supplications, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, so believers may live quiet and peaceful lives in godliness and honesty. He says this is good and acceptable before God our Saviour, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. He states that there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gives himself a ransom for all and is appointed a preacher and apostle.

He instructs men to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting. He instructs women to dress modestly, with proper clothing, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or costly clothing, but with good works. He says a woman is to learn in silence with all submission. He does not permit a woman to teach or to take authority over a man but to be in silence. He states that Adam forms first, then Eve, and that Adam is not deceived, but the woman is deceived and falls into transgression. He says she is saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, holiness, and sobriety.

## 1 Timothy 3: Qualifications for Bishops and Deacons

Paul states that if a man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work. A bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, able to teach, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, patient, not a brawler, not covetous. He must rule his own house well and have his children in submission. He must not be a novice, lest he fall into condemnation through pride. He must have a good report from those outside.

He gives similar qualifications for deacons: grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. They must first be tested. Their wives must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. Deacons must be husbands of one wife and rule their children and houses well. Paul writes so Timothy knows how to behave in the house of God, which he calls the church of the living God. He declares that the mystery of godliness is great: God is manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

## 1 Timothy 4: False Teachers and Timothy's Charge

The Spirit speaks clearly that in later times some depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of devils. He describes people who speak lies in hypocrisy, have their conscience seared, forbid marriage, and command abstaining from foods that God creates to be received with thanksgiving. He says every creature of God is good if received with thanksgiving, for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

Paul tells Timothy to put these things before the brethren and be a good minister of Jesus Christ. He warns against profane and old wives' fables and urges Timothy to exercise himself toward godliness. He says bodily exercise profits little, but godliness profits for this life and the life to come. He commands Timothy not to let anyone despise his youth but to be an example in word, conduct, love, spirit, faith, and purity. He urges him to give attention to reading, exhortation, and doctrine, and not to neglect the gift given by prophecy with the laying on of hands. He tells him to take heed to himself and to the doctrine, continuing in them.

## 1 Timothy 5: Widows, Elders, and Rebuke

Paul instructs Timothy not to rebuke an elder harshly but to treat him as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters with all purity. He gives instructions about honoring widows who are truly widows. If a widow has children or grandchildren, they are to repay their parents. A true widow trusts in God and continues in prayers. He describes qualifications for widows who may be supported, including age and good works. He warns younger widows against idleness and instructs them to marry, bear children, and guide the house.

He commands that elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and doctrine. He quotes that a laborer is worthy of his reward. He says not to receive an accusation against an elder except before two or three witnesses. Those who sin are to be rebuked before all. He charges Timothy before God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels to observe these things without partiality. He warns against laying hands suddenly on any man. He advises Timothy to use a little wine for his stomach's sake and frequent infirmities. He says some men's sins are open beforehand, and some follow after; likewise, good works are evident.

## 1 Timothy 6: Servants, Money, and Final Charge to Timothy

Paul instructs servants under the yoke to count their masters worthy of all honor so that the name of God and his doctrine are not blasphemed. Those with believing masters are not to despise them but to serve them. He warns that anyone who teaches otherwise and does not consent to sound words is proud, knowing nothing, and produces envy, strife, railings, and evil suspicions. He says the love of money is the root of all evil, and some, coveting it, stray from the faith and pierce themselves with many sorrows.

He tells Timothy, calling him a man of God, to flee these things and follow righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness. He urges him to fight the good fight of faith and hold eternal life. He charges him before God and Christ Jesus to keep the commandment without spot until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. He describes God as the blessed and only Potentate, King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality and dwells in light no man can approach. He instructs Timothy to command the rich not to be high-minded but to trust in the living God and to do good. He urges Timothy to keep what is committed to his trust and avoid profane and vain babblings and false knowledge, which some profess and stray from the faith.
