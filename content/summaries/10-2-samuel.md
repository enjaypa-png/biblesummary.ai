# 2 Samuel

## 2 Samuel 1: David Mourns Saul and Jonathan

The book of 2 Samuel opens with David at Ziklag, having just returned from his victory over the Amalekites. An Amalekite man arrives from Saul's camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head, bringing news of the battle at Mount Gilboa. He tells David that the Israelites have been defeated and that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead. To prove his story, he presents David with the crown and bracelet from Saul's arm. The man claims that he came upon the wounded Saul, who asked to be killed, and that he mercifully ended the king's life. He likely expects a reward for this news and for his role in the king's death.

David's reaction is one of profound grief, not triumph. He and his men tear their clothes and mourn, weep, and fast for Saul, Jonathan, and the fallen army of Israel. David then questions the Amalekite, who identifies himself as a foreigner. David is horrified that this man would dare to kill the Lord's anointed. Instead of a reward, David orders one of his men to strike the Amalekite down, declaring that the man's own testimony has condemned him. The chapter concludes with David composing a beautiful and moving lament, "The Song of the Bow," in honor of Saul and his beloved friend Jonathan. The lament mourns the fall of Israel's mighty heroes and expresses David's deep personal sorrow, especially for Jonathan, whose love he describes as "wonderful, passing the love of women."

## 2 Samuel 2: David Anointed King of Judah

After the period of mourning, David inquires of the Lord whether he should go up to one of the cities of Judah. The Lord directs him to go to Hebron. So David, along with his two wives and his loyal men and their families, moves to Hebron. There, the men of Judah come and formally anoint David as king over the house of Judah. David's first act as king is to send a message of blessing to the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had bravely recovered the bodies of Saul and his sons and given them a proper burial.

Meanwhile, Abner, the commander of Saul's army, takes Saul's surviving son, Ish-bosheth, and makes him king over the rest of Israel from the city of Mahanaim, across the Jordan. This sets the stage for a civil war between the house of Saul and the house of David. A tense standoff occurs at the pool of Gibeon between the forces of Joab (the commander of David's army) and the forces of Abner. Abner proposes a contest between twelve young men from each side, which quickly escalates into a deadly fight and then a full-blown battle. Abner's forces are defeated. During the pursuit, Joab's swift-footed brother, Asahel, relentlessly pursues Abner. Abner, not wanting to kill Asahel and create a blood feud with Joab, repeatedly warns him to turn aside, but Asahel refuses. In self-defense, Abner strikes Asahel with the butt end of his spear, killing him. The chapter ends with Joab and his men returning to Hebron after a day of fierce fighting.

## 2 Samuel 3: The House of David Grows Stronger

The war between the house of Saul and the house of David is long and drawn out. The narrative states that David's house grows progressively stronger, while Saul's house grows weaker. During his time as king in Hebron, David has six sons born to him by his different wives. A major turning point in the civil war comes when Abner, the real power behind Ish-bosheth's throne, has a dispute with the weak king. Ish-bosheth accuses Abner of sleeping with one of Saul's concubines, an act that could be interpreted as a bid for the throne.

Enraged by the accusation, Abner decides to defect to David's side. He sends messengers to David, offering to bring all of Israel under his rule. David agrees, but on one condition: Abner must bring Saul's daughter Michal, David's first wife, with him. Abner agrees and orchestrates Michal's return. He then begins to persuade the elders of Israel to support David. However, Joab, David's commander, has not forgotten that Abner killed his brother Asahel. When Abner comes to Hebron to finalize the agreement with David, Joab, acting out of personal vengeance, lures Abner aside and murders him. David is furious and publicly mourns for Abner, cursing Joab and his family. He makes it clear to all of Israel that he had nothing to do with Abner's death, thus strengthening his own political position.

## 2 Samuel 4: The Murder of Ish-bosheth

When Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, hears that Abner has been killed in Hebron, he loses all courage, and all Israel is alarmed. The house of Saul is now left without its strong military leader. Two of Ish-bosheth's own army captains, Baanah and Rechab, see an opportunity for personal gain. They enter Ish-bosheth's house in the middle of the day, while he is taking his midday rest, and assassinate him, cutting off his head. They then escape and travel all night to bring the head to David in Hebron, expecting a reward for eliminating his rival.

Just as he did with the Amalekite who claimed to have killed Saul, David reacts not with pleasure but with righteous anger. He recounts how he dealt with the man who brought him the news of Saul's death, and he condemns Baanah and Rechab for their treacherous act of murdering a righteous man in his own house on his own bed. He orders his men to execute them. They are put to death, their hands and feet are cut off, and their bodies are hung up by the pool in Hebron. The head of Ish-bosheth, however, is taken and given a proper burial in Abner's tomb.

## 2 Samuel 5: David Becomes King Over All Israel

With the house of Saul now completely collapsed, all the tribes of Israel come to David at Hebron and declare their allegiance to him. They acknowledge him as their kinsman, their proven military leader, and the one whom the Lord has chosen to be the shepherd and ruler of Israel. The elders of Israel make a covenant with David, and they anoint him as king over all of Israel. He is thirty years old when he begins to reign, and he will reign for a total of forty years.

One of David's first acts as king of a united Israel is to capture the city of Jerusalem from the Jebusites. The Jebusites are so confident in their fortress that they taunt David, saying that even the blind and the lame could defend it. But David and his men conquer the stronghold of Zion through the water shaft, and it becomes known as the City of David. David establishes Jerusalem as his capital, and his power and influence grow, for the Lord God Almighty is with him. The chapter also notes that Hiram, the king of Tyre, sends envoys to David with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons to build a palace for him. The Philistines, alarmed by David's growing power, twice march their armies against him. Both times, David inquires of the Lord and, following God's instructions, achieves a decisive victory over them.

## 2 Samuel 6: The Ark Is Brought to Jerusalem

David gathers 30,000 chosen men of Israel and goes to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to Jerusalem. They place the Ark on a new cart and begin the journey with great celebration, with music and shouting. However, the procession comes to a tragic halt when the oxen pulling the cart stumble. A man named Uzzah reaches out his hand to steady the Ark, an act of irreverence, as only the Levites were permitted to handle it. The Lord's anger is kindled, and He strikes Uzzah down, and he dies there beside the Ark.

David is both angry and afraid because of what has happened. He renames the place Perez Uzzah ("the breaking out against Uzzah") and decides he cannot bring the Ark into the City of David. Instead, he has it taken to the house of a man named Obed-Edom the Gittite. The Ark remains there for three months, and the Lord blesses Obed-Edom and his entire household. When David hears of this blessing, he takes it as a sign that it is now safe to move the Ark. This time, he follows the proper procedures, having the Levites carry the Ark on their shoulders. With great joy, sacrifices, and celebration, David leads the procession into Jerusalem. He is so filled with joy that he leaps and dances before the Lord, wearing only a linen ephod. His wife Michal, Saul's daughter, sees him from a window and despises him in her heart for what she perceives as undignified behavior. When she later confronts him, David rebukes her, and the chapter notes that Michal remains childless for the rest of her life.

## 2 Samuel 7: The Davidic Covenant

Now that David is established in his palace and has rest from his enemies, he expresses to the prophet Nathan his desire to build a permanent temple for the Ark of the Covenant, feeling it is not right that he lives in a house of cedar while the Ark of God remains in a tent. Nathan initially encourages the king, but that night, the Lord speaks to Nathan in a vision and gives him a different message for David. The Lord reminds David that He has never asked for a house to dwell in and that He has been with David and has made his name great.

Instead of David building a house for God, the Lord declares that He will build a "house" for David—a lasting dynasty. This is the establishment of the Davidic Covenant, a pivotal promise in the Old Testament. The Lord promises that David's son will build the temple and that God will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. Even if David's descendants sin and require discipline, God's love and favor will never be taken from them as it was from Saul. The Lord declares, "Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever." In response to this extraordinary promise, David offers a humble and heartfelt prayer of thanksgiving, praising God for His greatness and for His gracious promises to him and to the nation of Israel.

## 2 Samuel 8: David's Victories

This chapter provides a summary of David's military victories and the consolidation of his kingdom. He achieves a series of decisive victories over Israel's surrounding enemies, extending the borders of his empire and bringing peace and security to the nation. He defeats the Philistines to the west, subduing them and taking control of their major city, Metheg Ammah. To the east, he defeats the Moabites, dealing with them harshly.

David also wins a major victory over Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, an Aramean kingdom to the north, capturing many horsemen and chariots. When the Arameans of Damascus come to help Hadadezer, David defeats them as well, placing garrisons in their territory and making them subject to him. From these northern campaigns, he brings back a large amount of plunder, including gold, silver, and bronze, which he dedicates to the Lord. To the south, he defeats the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, establishing garrisons throughout Edom. The chapter concludes by summarizing David's successful reign: "And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people." It also lists the key officials in his administration, including Joab as commander of the army, Jehoshaphat as recorder, Zadok and Ahimelech as priests, and Seraiah as scribe.

## 2 Samuel 9: David and Mephibosheth

With his kingdom now secure, David remembers the covenant he made with his friend Jonathan. He asks if there is anyone left from the house of Saul to whom he can show kindness for Jonathan's sake. He is told about Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, who is lame in both feet as a result of a childhood accident when he was dropped by his nurse as she fled with him after the news of Saul and Jonathan's deaths. David summons Mephibosheth to the palace.

Mephibosheth comes before David in fear, expecting the worst, as it was common practice for a new king to eliminate all potential rivals from the previous dynasty. However, David reassures him, telling him not to be afraid. In an act of extraordinary grace and kindness, David restores to Mephibosheth all the land that had belonged to his grandfather Saul. Furthermore, he invites Mephibosheth to eat at the king's table for the rest of his life, treating him as one of his own sons. David appoints Ziba, a former servant of Saul, and his household to manage the land for Mephibosheth. The chapter ends with Mephibosheth living in Jerusalem and eating at the king's table, a living testament to David's faithfulness to his covenant with Jonathan.

## 2 Samuel 10: The Ammonite and Aramean War

The king of the Ammonites, who had shown kindness to David in the past, dies, and his son Hanun succeeds him. David sends a delegation to express his sympathy and to show kindness to Hanun. However, Hanun's advisors convince him that David's men are not envoys of peace but are spies sent to explore and overthrow the city. Humiliating foreign ambassadors was a grave insult, and Hanun does just that: he shaves off half of each man's beard, cuts off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sends them away in disgrace. When David hears of this, he is furious and tells his men to wait in Jericho until their beards have grown back.

Realizing they have made a powerful enemy, the Ammonites hire Aramean (Syrian) mercenaries to help them fight against Israel. David sends Joab and the entire Israelite army to confront them. Joab finds himself trapped, with the Ammonite army in front of him at their city gate and the Aramean army behind him in the open country. He divides his forces, leading the elite troops against the Arameans and placing the rest under the command of his brother Abishai to fight the Ammonites. He devises a strategy where they will support each other as needed. Joab's attack is successful; the Arameans flee, and when the Ammonites see this, they too retreat into their city. The Arameans regroup for another battle, but David himself leads the Israelite army in a second, decisive victory, killing the Aramean commander and routing their forces. The Arameans then make peace with Israel and become subject to them, and the Ammonites are left without their powerful allies.

## 2 Samuel 11: David and Bathsheba

This chapter marks the great turning point in David's life and reign. It is springtime, the season when kings go off to war. David, however, remains in Jerusalem while he sends Joab and the Israelite army to besiege the Ammonite city of Rabbah. One evening, David is walking on the roof of his palace when he sees a beautiful woman bathing. He inquires about her and learns that she is Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of his most loyal soldiers who is away at the siege.

David sends for Bathsheba, sleeps with her, and she becomes pregnant. To cover up his sin, David summons Uriah back from the battle, hoping he will sleep with his wife, which would make the child appear to be his. However, Uriah, in a display of remarkable integrity, refuses to go to his house and enjoy the comforts of home while the Ark and his fellow soldiers are in tents on the battlefield. He sleeps at the entrance to the palace. David's second attempt, getting Uriah drunk, also fails. Desperate, David resorts to a wicked and murderous plan. He sends a letter back with Uriah to Joab, instructing him to put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest and then to withdraw from him, so that he will be struck down and killed. Joab obeys the king's command. Uriah is killed in the battle. After Bathsheba's period of mourning is over, David brings her to his palace and marries her. The chapter ends with the ominous words: "But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord."

## 2 Samuel 12: Nathan Rebukes David

The Lord sends the prophet Nathan to confront David. Nathan tells David a parable about a rich man and a poor man. The rich man had many flocks and herds, while the poor man had only one little ewe lamb, which he loved like a daughter. When a traveler came to the rich man, instead of taking a sheep from his own flock, he stole the poor man's lamb and prepared it for his guest. David is enraged by this injustice and declares that the rich man deserves to die. Nathan then points his finger at David and says, "Thou art the man."

Nathan proceeds to deliver God's judgment. He reminds David of all that God has given him—the kingdom, Saul's house, and his wives—and says that God would have given him even more. He rebukes David for despising the Lord's command by killing Uriah and taking his wife. As a consequence, Nathan declares that the "sword shall never depart from thine house." He also prophesies that God will raise up evil against David from within his own household and that his wives will be taken and slept with in broad daylight. David is cut to the heart and confesses his sin: "I have sinned against the Lord." Nathan assures him that the Lord has put away his sin and he will not die, but because he has given the enemies of the Lord a reason to show contempt, the child born to him and Bathsheba will die. The child does become ill, and despite David's fasting and praying, the child dies on the seventh day. David accepts God's judgment, and he then comforts Bathsheba. She later gives birth to another son, whom they name Solomon, and whom the Lord loves.

## 2 Samuel 13: Amnon, Tamar, and Absalom

The consequences of David's sin begin to unfold as the sword enters his own house. David's eldest son, Amnon, develops an obsessive lust for his beautiful half-sister, Tamar. Following the wicked advice of his cunning cousin Jonadab, Amnon pretends to be ill and asks his father, King David, to have Tamar come and prepare food for him. When Tamar comes to his room, Amnon seizes her and rapes her, ignoring her desperate pleas.

After the violent act, Amnon's lust turns to an intense hatred, and he cruelly throws her out of his room. The devastated Tamar tears her robe, a sign of her virginity, puts ashes on her head, and goes away weeping. Her full brother, Absalom, sees her and understands what has happened. He comforts her but tells her to be quiet for now. He develops a deep and bitter hatred for Amnon. King David hears of the incident and is furious, but he does nothing to punish his firstborn son. For two years, Absalom nurses his grudge. He then devises a plan for revenge. He invites all the king's sons, including Amnon, to a sheep-shearing festival. While they are merry with wine, Absalom's servants, on his command, strike down and kill Amnon. The other princes flee in terror. Absalom then flees to Geshur, where he remains in exile for three years.

## 2 Samuel 14: Absalom's Return

Joab, David's commander, perceives that King David's heart longs for his exiled son, Absalom. To facilitate a reconciliation, Joab devises a clever plan. He hires a wise woman from Tekoa and instructs her to go to the king, pretending to be a widow in mourning. She tells the king a fabricated story about her two sons, one of whom killed the other. Now, she says, the rest of the family is demanding that the surviving son be put to death, which would leave her without an heir and extinguish her husband's name. David, moved by her story, promises to protect her son.

The woman then skillfully applies the story to the king's own situation, pointing out that by keeping his own son, Absalom, in exile, he is acting against the well-being of his own house and the nation. David realizes that Joab is behind the woman's appeal. He agrees to allow Absalom to return to Jerusalem, but on the condition that he does not see the king's face. Absalom returns and lives in Jerusalem for two full years without being admitted to the royal court. Frustrated, Absalom twice summons Joab, who refuses to come. Absalom then forces Joab's hand by setting his barley field on fire. Joab finally comes, and Absalom persuades him to arrange a meeting with the king. David agrees to see his son. Absalom comes before the king and bows down, and David kisses him, a sign of formal reconciliation.

## 2 Samuel 15: Absalom's Conspiracy

Despite the reconciliation, Absalom begins to conspire against his father. He starts a systematic campaign to win the hearts of the people of Israel. He gets himself a chariot and horses, with fifty men to run ahead of him, creating an image of royal authority. He stands by the city gate and intercepts people coming to the king for justice. He sympathizes with their legal disputes, tells them their claims are just, and laments that there is no one appointed by the king to hear their cases. He suggests that if he were judge, everyone would get justice. In this way, he "stole the hearts of the men of Israel."

After four years, Absalom tells his father he needs to go to Hebron to fulfill a vow he made while in exile. This is a pretext for launching his rebellion. From Hebron, the historic city where David himself was first crowned, Absalom sends secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel, telling them that when they hear the sound of the trumpet, they are to proclaim that Absalom is king in Hebron. The conspiracy gains momentum, and many people, including Ahithophel, one of David's most trusted counselors, join Absalom. A messenger comes to David in Jerusalem with the news: "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom." Realizing the gravity of the situation, David and his entire household flee Jerusalem to escape the approaching rebel army.

## 2 Samuel 16: David Flees Jerusalem

As David and his followers are leaving Jerusalem, they are met by Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, who brings provisions for the king and his household. When David asks where Mephibosheth is, Ziba lies, claiming that Mephibosheth has remained in Jerusalem, hoping that the kingdom will now be restored to the house of Saul. Believing this slander, David rashly declares that everything that belonged to Mephibosheth now belongs to Ziba.

As David's party continues on, a man from Saul's clan named Shimei comes out from a nearby village. He follows them, cursing David loudly, throwing stones at him and his officials, and accusing him of being a man of blood who has usurped Saul's throne. Abishai, Joab's brother, wants to kill Shimei for cursing the king, but David restrains him. In a remarkable display of humility, David accepts the cursing as possibly being from the Lord, a just punishment for his own sins. Meanwhile, Absalom and his followers, including the treacherous counselor Ahithophel, enter Jerusalem. Ahithophel gives Absalom a piece of public and symbolic advice: he is to sleep with his father's concubines, whom David had left behind to care for the palace. By doing this in a tent on the palace roof, in the sight of all Israel, Absalom will make a definitive and public break with his father, solidifying the support of his followers.

## 2 Samuel 17: The Counsel of Ahithophel and Hushai

Ahithophel, Absalom's new chief counselor, advises Absalom to let him take 12,000 men and pursue David immediately, while he is weary and weak. He plans to strike down only the king, which he believes will cause the rest of David's followers to return peacefully to Absalom. This counsel seems wise to Absalom and the elders of Israel. However, Absalom decides to also seek the advice of Hushai the Archite, who is secretly a spy for David. Hushai, knowing that Ahithophel's plan is sound and would be disastrous for David, offers a different strategy. He argues that David and his men are mighty warriors and will be fierce, like a bear robbed of her cubs. He suggests that a surprise attack could go wrong and that Absalom should instead gather a massive army from all over Israel, with Absalom himself leading them into battle. This appeals to Absalom's vanity, and he and his men choose Hushai's counsel over Ahithophel's.

Hushai immediately sends word to David through the priests Zadok and Abiathar, telling him to cross the Jordan River without delay. When Ahithophel sees that his advice has been rejected, he recognizes that the rebellion is doomed to fail. He goes home, puts his affairs in order, and hangs himself. David and his followers cross the Jordan and establish a new base of operations in the city of Mahanaim, where they are welcomed and provided with supplies by loyal supporters.

## 2 Samuel 18: The Death of Absalom

David organizes his army and, against the strong advice of his men, wants to lead them into battle himself. They persuade him to remain in the city, as his life is worth more than all of theirs. As the army marches out, David gives a strict command to his three commanders—Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: "Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom." The battle takes place in the forest of Ephraim, and David's experienced soldiers decisively defeat the rebel army of Israel, with 20,000 men being killed.

During the battle, Absalom, riding his mule, gets his long, thick hair caught in the branches of a large oak tree. He is left hanging, suspended between heaven and earth. One of David's men sees him and reports it to Joab. Joab, who has no patience for David's sentimentality toward the rebel prince, takes three javelins and thrusts them into Absalom's heart. Ten of Joab's armor-bearers then surround Absalom and finish him off. Joab sounds the trumpet to stop the pursuit of the fleeing Israelites. They take Absalom's body, throw it into a large pit in the forest, and cover it with a huge pile of stones. Two messengers are sent to inform David of the victory. The first, Ahimaaz, runs ahead but, in his eagerness, does not give the full news. The second messenger, a Cushite, arrives and bluntly informs the king that his son Absalom is dead. David is utterly devastated by the news. He goes up to the chamber over the gate and weeps, crying out repeatedly, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"

## 2 Samuel 19: David's Return to Jerusalem

David's overwhelming grief for Absalom turns the joy of victory into a day of mourning for the entire army. The soldiers, who have just risked their lives for the king, now feel ashamed and sneak back into the city as if they have fled in defeat. Joab, ever the pragmatist, goes to the king and delivers a harsh but necessary rebuke. He tells David that he is shaming his loyal soldiers and showing love for his enemies and hatred for his friends. He warns the king that if he does not go out and speak encouragingly to his men, not a single one of them will remain with him by nightfall. David heeds Joab's counsel, goes to the city gate, and sits there, and the army comes before him.

With the rebellion over, the tribes of Israel begin to argue among themselves about bringing the king back. David sends a message to the elders of his own tribe, Judah, urging them to be the first to welcome him back to Jerusalem. He also makes a politically astute move by offering to make Amasa, the commander of Absalom's rebel army, the new commander of his own army in place of Joab. This wins over the men of Judah. As David returns, several key figures from his flight come to meet him. Shimei, who had cursed him, comes to beg for forgiveness, and David spares his life. Mephibosheth also comes, explaining that his servant Ziba had slandered him, and David partially reverses his earlier rash judgment. Barzillai, the elderly man who had provided for David at Mahanaim, comes to see him across the Jordan, and David invites him to the palace, but Barzillai declines due to his old age.

## 2 Samuel 20: The Rebellion of Sheba

As David is returning to Jerusalem, a dispute arises between the men of Judah and the men of the other tribes of Israel. The men of Israel feel that the tribe of Judah has acted unilaterally in bringing the king back and has not given them their proper share of honor. This simmering resentment is exploited by a troublemaker named Sheba, from the tribe of Benjamin, who sounds a trumpet and cries, "We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel!" The men of Israel abandon David and follow Sheba.

David arrives in Jerusalem and immediately deals with the ten concubines he had left behind, placing them in seclusion for the rest of their lives. He then orders Amasa, his newly appointed commander, to assemble the army of Judah within three days to pursue Sheba. Amasa, however, is slow to respond. David, fearing that Sheba's rebellion could become more dangerous than Absalom's, sends Abishai and Joab's elite troops in pursuit. Joab, though officially replaced, is still the de facto leader. When they meet Amasa at Gibeon, Joab greets him, pretends to kiss him, and then treacherously murders him, just as he had murdered Abner. Joab then resumes command of the army and pursues Sheba to the northern city of Abel Beth Maakah. He besieges the city, and a wise woman from the city negotiates with him. To save the city from destruction, the inhabitants kill Sheba, cut off his head, and throw it over the wall to Joab. The rebellion is ended, and Joab returns to Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 21: Famine and Giants

There is a three-year famine in the land, and when David inquires of the Lord, he is told that it is because of Saul and his blood-stained house, for he had put the Gibeonites to death. The Gibeonites were a people with whom Israel had made a treaty of protection long ago, in the time of Joshua. David summons the Gibeonites and asks what he can do to make atonement. They do not ask for money but for justice: they demand that seven of Saul's male descendants be handed over to them to be executed.

David agrees and spares Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, because of his oath to Jonathan. He hands over two of Saul's sons (born to his concubine Rizpah) and five of Saul's grandsons. The Gibeonites execute them and leave their bodies exposed on a hill. Rizpah, in a moving display of maternal devotion, keeps a vigil over the bodies for months, protecting them from birds and wild animals. When David hears of her loyalty, he is moved to act. He retrieves the bones of Saul and Jonathan from Jabesh Gilead and, along with the bones of the seven who were executed, gives them all a proper burial in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father. After this, the famine ends. The chapter concludes with a series of brief accounts of battles with the Philistines, in which David's mighty men distinguish themselves by killing four Philistine giants, descendants of Rapha in Gath.

## 2 Samuel 22: David's Song of Praise

This chapter is a song of praise and thanksgiving that David sings to the Lord after He has delivered him from all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. This psalm is nearly identical to Psalm 18. It is a powerful and poetic celebration of God's faithfulness, power, and salvation. David begins by declaring the Lord as his rock, his fortress, and his deliverer. He describes a time of great distress, when the cords of death and the torrents of destruction entangled him, and he cried out to the Lord for help.

In dramatic, anthropomorphic language, David depicts the Lord's mighty response. The earth trembles, smoke and fire pour from His nostrils and mouth, and He parts the heavens and comes down on a cherub, riding on the wings of the wind. He thunders from heaven and shoots forth lightning, scattering David's enemies. The song then shifts to celebrate God's justice and righteousness. David proclaims that the Lord has rewarded him according to his righteousness and the cleanness of his hands, for he has kept the ways of the Lord and has not turned from His commands. The song concludes with a confident affirmation of God's continued blessing on David and his descendants forever, for God gives his king great victories and shows unfailing love to His anointed.

## 2 Samuel 23: David's Last Words and Mighty Men

This chapter begins with the "last words of David," a short, prophetic oracle. In it, David reflects on his own status as the anointed of God and declares that the Spirit of the Lord speaks through him. He describes the ideal ruler as one who rules justly and in the fear of God, bringing light and life like the morning sun. He contrasts this with the fate of the wicked, who are like thorns to be cast away and burned. He expresses confidence in God's everlasting covenant with him and his house.

The remainder of the chapter is dedicated to listing and celebrating David's "mighty men," the elite warriors who were the foundation of his military success. They are divided into two groups. The first group is "The Three," the most distinguished of all his warriors. The chief of these is Josheb-Basshebeth, who is said to have killed 800 men in one encounter. The other two are Eleazar, who stood his ground against the Philistines until his hand froze to his sword, and Shammah, who single-handedly defended a field of lentils from a Philistine raiding party. The chapter also recounts an incident where three of these mighty men risk their lives to break through Philistine lines to bring David a drink of water from the well at Bethlehem. David, however, refuses to drink it, pouring it out as an offering to the Lord, for it represents the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives. The chapter concludes with a longer list of "The Thirty," another group of distinguished warriors, which includes notable figures like Asahel, Benaiah, and Uriah the Hittite.

## 2 Samuel 24: David's Census and the Plague

In the final chapter of the book, the Lord's anger is once again kindled against Israel, and He incites David to take a census of the fighting men of Israel and Judah. This act, though not fully explained, is presented as a sinful one, perhaps reflecting a reliance on military might rather than on God. Joab, David's commander, strongly advises against it, but the king's command overrules him. Joab and the army commanders spend over nine months traveling throughout the land to count the men.

After the census is completed, David's conscience is struck, and he confesses his sin to the Lord. The next morning, the Lord sends the prophet Gad to David to offer him a choice of three punishments: three years of famine, three months of fleeing from his enemies, or three days of plague in the land. David, choosing to fall into the hands of the merciful God rather than into the hands of men, chooses the three-day plague. The Lord sends a plague on Israel, and 70,000 people die. As the destroying angel reaches Jerusalem and is about to strike the city, the Lord relents and stops the plague. David sees the angel by the threshing floor of a man named Araunah the Jebusite. He prays to the Lord, taking full responsibility and asking that the punishment fall on him and his family, not on the innocent people. The Lord, through the prophet Gad, instructs David to build an altar on Araunah's threshing floor. Araunah offers to give David the threshing floor, the oxen, and the wood for free, but David insists on paying the full price, saying, "Neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing." He buys the threshing floor and the oxen, builds an altar, and offers sacrifices. The Lord answers his prayer, and the plague on Israel is stopped. This site will later become the location of Solomon's Temple.
