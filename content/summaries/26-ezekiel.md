## Ezekiel 1: Visions of God

The word of the LORD comes to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the river Chebar in the land of the Chaldeans. He sees visions of God as the heavens open. A great cloud comes from the north with a fire flashing continually and brightness around it, and from the midst appears something like glowing metal. From the fire emerge four living creatures, each with the likeness of a man. Each has four faces and four wings, and their legs are straight with feet like a calf's foot, shining like polished brass. Their faces are those of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, and their wings are joined one to another as they move straight forward without turning.

Beside each living creature appears a wheel on the earth, and the wheels have the appearance of a wheel within a wheel. Their rims are high and full of eyes all around. When the living creatures move, the wheels move with them, and the spirit of the living creature is in the wheels. Above the heads of the living creatures is the likeness of a firmament like crystal, and above the firmament is the likeness of a throne like a sapphire stone. Upon the throne is the likeness of a man with brightness like fire and a rainbow around him. Ezekiel sees the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD, and when he sees it, he falls upon his face and hears a voice speaking.

## Ezekiel 2: Son of Man, Stand Upon Your Feet

The voice says to him, "Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak unto you." The Spirit enters him and sets him on his feet, and the LORD speaks to him. The LORD says he sends him to the children of Israel, a rebellious nation that has transgressed against Him. Their fathers have rebelled, and they continue in stubbornness and impudence. Ezekiel is sent to speak the LORD's words to them whether they hear or refuse to hear. The LORD tells him they shall know that a prophet has been among them.

The LORD warns him not to fear them or their words, though they are like briers and thorns and though he dwells among scorpions. He is not to be afraid of their faces. He must speak the LORD's words to them whether they listen or refuse, for they are most rebellious. The LORD commands him not to be rebellious like that rebellious house. He is told to open his mouth and eat what the LORD gives him. He sees a hand with a scroll written inside and outside with lamentations, mourning, and woe.

## Ezekiel 3: Eat the Scroll and Be a Watchman

The LORD tells Ezekiel to eat the scroll and fill his belly with it. He eats it, and it is sweet as honey in his mouth. The LORD sends him to the house of Israel, not to a people of strange speech but to his own people, who will not listen because they will not listen to the LORD. The LORD makes his face strong against their faces and his forehead hard against their foreheads. He tells him not to fear them. The Spirit lifts him up, and he hears a voice of a great rushing, saying, "Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place."

Ezekiel comes to the captives at Telabib by the river Chebar and sits astonished among them seven days. After seven days the word of the LORD comes to him and appoints him a watchman to the house of Israel. He is warned that if he does not warn the wicked, their blood will be required at his hand, but if he warns them and they do not turn, he has delivered his soul. The same warning applies to the righteous who turn to sin. The LORD tells him to go into the plain, where the glory of the LORD appears again as before, and he falls on his face. The Spirit sets him on his feet and tells him he will be bound and made unable to speak except when the LORD opens his mouth to say, "Thus saith the Lord GOD."

## Ezekiel 4: Sign of the Siege

The LORD commands Ezekiel to take a tile and portray Jerusalem upon it and lay siege against it. He is to build a fort and mount against it and set battering rams around it. He must lie on his left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it for a number of days equal to their years of iniquity. He then lies on his right side for the iniquity of the house of Judah. He is bound and cannot turn from one side to the other until he has ended the days of his siege.

He is commanded to take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt and make bread by weight, eating it by measure each day. He must drink water by measure as well. He is first told to bake it with human dung as fuel, but he objects that he has not defiled himself, and the LORD allows him to use cow's dung instead. The LORD says He will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem so they eat bread by weight and drink water by measure in fear and astonishment. They will lack bread and water and be consumed for their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5: The Razor and the Hair

The LORD tells Ezekiel to take a sharp knife and use it as a barber's razor upon his head and beard. He must divide the hair into thirds by weight. One third he burns in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled. One third he strikes with a knife around the city, and one third he scatters in the wind, and the LORD says He will draw out a sword after them. A few hairs he binds in his skirts, and from them he throws some into the fire.

The LORD says this is Jerusalem set in the midst of the nations, and she has rebelled more than the nations around her. Because of her abominations, the LORD will execute judgments in her sight. Fathers will eat sons, and sons will eat fathers, and He will scatter the remnant to all winds. He declares that His eye will not spare and He will not pity. A third will die by pestilence and famine, a third by the sword, and a third will be scattered. They shall know that He is the LORD when He accomplishes His fury upon them.

## Ezekiel 6: Prophecy Against the Mountains of Israel

The word of the LORD comes, telling Ezekiel to set his face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. He declares that the LORD will bring a sword upon them and destroy their high places. Their altars will be desolate, and their images broken. The slain will fall before their idols, and their bones will be laid around their altars. Cities will be laid waste, and incense altars cut down.

Yet the LORD says He will leave a remnant that escapes the sword among the nations. Those who escape will remember Him among the nations where they are carried captive. They will loathe themselves for the evils they have committed in all their abominations. They shall know that He is the LORD. He commands Ezekiel to smite with his hand and stamp with his foot and cry against the abominations of Israel. By sword, famine, and pestilence they will fall, and the land will be made desolate from the wilderness toward Diblath.

## Ezekiel 7: The End Has Come

The word of the LORD comes concerning the land of Israel, declaring that an end has come upon the four corners of the land. The LORD says He will send His anger upon them and judge them according to their ways. His eye will not spare, and He will recompense their abominations. An evil, only evil, has come. The morning has come unto them, and the time has come.

The trumpet sounds, but none goes to battle because of the LORD's wrath. The sword is without, and pestilence and famine within. Those in the field die by the sword, and those in the city by famine and pestilence. Silver and gold will not deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath. Their wealth becomes spoil, and strangers possess it. The LORD gives the land into the hands of the wicked. The law perishes from the priest, counsel from the elders, and the king mourns. He does to them according to their way, and they shall know that He is the LORD.

## Ezekiel 8: Abominations in the Temple

In the sixth year, elders of Judah sit before Ezekiel in his house, and the hand of the Lord GOD falls upon him. He sees the likeness of a man with the appearance of fire and brightness. The Spirit lifts him between earth and heaven and brings him in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate. He sees the image of jealousy that provokes to jealousy. The LORD asks him if he sees what they do, the great abominations that drive Him far from His sanctuary.

He is brought to a door in the court and sees elders of Israel with censers in their hands before creeping things and abominable beasts portrayed upon the wall. They say the LORD does not see them. He sees women weeping for Tammuz and men worshiping the sun toward the east with their backs to the temple. The LORD says they have filled the land with violence and returned to provoke Him to anger. He declares He will deal in fury, and though they cry in His ears, He will not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9: The Mark and the Slaughter

Ezekiel hears a loud voice calling for those who have charge over the city to draw near, each with a destroying weapon. Six men come from the upper gate, and one among them is clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn. The glory of the God of Israel moves to the threshold of the house. The LORD tells the man clothed with linen to go through Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry for all the abominations done in the midst.

To the others He says to follow and smite, letting not their eye spare nor pity. They are to slay old and young, maidens and children, but not to come near any man upon whom is the mark. They begin at the sanctuary with the ancient men before the house. Ezekiel falls upon his face and cries, asking if the LORD will destroy all the residue of Israel. The LORD answers that the iniquity of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood. The man clothed with linen reports that he has done as commanded.

## Ezekiel 10: Fire and the Departure of Glory

Ezekiel sees above the firmament over the cherubim the likeness of a throne. The LORD commands the man clothed with linen to take coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city. The cherubim stand on the right side of the house as the man goes in. The glory of the LORD goes up from the cherub to the threshold, and the house is filled with the cloud and the court with brightness.

The sound of the cherubim's wings is heard as the voice of Almighty God when He speaks. The man takes fire from between the cherubim. The cherubim have the same appearance as before, each with four faces and wheels beside them full of eyes. The glory of the LORD departs from off the threshold and stands over the cherubim. They lift up their wings and rise from the earth in Ezekiel's sight. The glory of the LORD goes up from the midst of the city and stands upon the mountain on the east side of the city.

## Ezekiel 11: Wicked Counselors and a Promise of Restoration

The Spirit lifts Ezekiel and brings him to the east gate of the LORD's house, where twenty-five men are at the door, including Jaazaniah and Pelatiah, princes of the people. The LORD says these are the men who devise mischief and give wicked counsel in Jerusalem. They say the city is the caldron and they are the flesh. The LORD declares He will bring a sword upon them and judge them at the border of Israel.

As Ezekiel prophesies, Pelatiah dies, and Ezekiel falls on his face and cries to the Lord GOD. The LORD says though He scatters them among the nations, He will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries where they come. He promises to gather them and give them the land of Israel and remove their detestable things. He will give them one heart and put a new spirit within them. The glory of the LORD goes up from the city and stands on the mountain on the east side. The Spirit brings Ezekiel back to the captivity in vision, and he speaks all the things he has seen.

## Ezekiel 12: Sign of Exile

The word of the LORD comes to Ezekiel, calling him "son of man" and saying he dwells in the midst of a rebellious house that has eyes to see but does not see and ears to hear but does not hear. The LORD commands him to prepare baggage for exile and remove by day in their sight. He is to go from his place to another place in their sight as a sign. In the evening he must go forth through a hole he digs in the wall, carrying his belongings on his shoulder in their sight. He must cover his face so that he does not see the ground, for the LORD has set him as a sign to the house of Israel.

Ezekiel does as he is commanded. In the morning the word of the LORD comes again, telling him to explain the sign. He says it concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel. The prince will bear his belongings on his shoulder at twilight and go out through a hole in the wall, and he will be taken in a net and brought to Babylon. Yet he will not see it though he dies there. The LORD says He will scatter all who are around him and draw out a sword after them. He declares they shall know that He is the LORD when He scatters them, though a few will escape to declare their abominations among the nations.

## Ezekiel 13: False Prophets and Prophetesses

The word of the LORD comes against the prophets of Israel who prophesy out of their own hearts. The LORD says they have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, "The LORD saith," when the LORD has not sent them. They have made the people hope that they would confirm the word. The LORD declares He is against these prophets and that they will not be in the assembly of His people nor written in the writing of the house of Israel. They have seduced the people, saying, "Peace," when there is no peace, building a wall and others daubing it with untempered mortar.

The LORD says the wall will fall in a stormy wind and overflowing shower. He asks where the daubing is when it falls. He also speaks against the prophetesses who sew pillows to armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head to hunt souls. They profane Him among His people for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, slaying souls that should not die and saving alive souls that should not live by their lying. The LORD says He will tear their pillows and deliver His people out of their hand. They shall know that He is the LORD.

## Ezekiel 14: Idolatrous Elders and Righteousness

Certain elders of Israel come to Ezekiel and sit before him. The word of the LORD says these men have set up idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. The LORD says He will answer them according to the multitude of their idols. He calls them to repent and turn from their idols and abominations. If any man separates himself from the LORD and sets up idols, the LORD will set His face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb.

If a prophet is deceived and speaks a word, the LORD says He has deceived that prophet and will destroy him. The iniquity of the prophet and of him that seeks him shall be alike. The LORD declares that though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the land, they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness. He speaks of four sore judgments: sword, famine, evil beasts, and pestilence. Yet a remnant will escape and come forth, and their ways will comfort those who see them. They shall know that He has not done without cause all that He has done in Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 15: Jerusalem as Useless Vine Wood

The word of the LORD asks what the wood of the vine is more than any tree. It is not used to make any work or even a peg to hang a vessel upon. If it is cast into the fire for fuel, the fire devours both ends and burns the midst of it. It is not fit for any work when whole, much less when burned.

So the LORD says He will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem as the wood of the vine to the fire. He sets His face against them. Though they go out from one fire, another fire will devour them. They shall know that He is the LORD when He sets His face against them. He makes the land desolate because they have committed a trespass.

## Ezekiel 16: Jerusalem as an Unfaithful Bride

The word of the LORD comes to Ezekiel to cause Jerusalem to know her abominations. The LORD describes her birth in the land of Canaan, cast out and not washed or pitied. He passes by and sees her polluted in her blood and says to her, "Live." She grows and becomes beautiful. He spreads His skirt over her and enters into covenant with her, and she becomes His.

He decks her with ornaments, fine linen, silk, and jewels. But she trusts in her beauty and plays the harlot with passing strangers. She builds high places and commits abominations with idols. She sacrifices her sons and daughters. The LORD declares He will gather her lovers against her and uncover her nakedness. Yet He remembers His covenant in the days of her youth and will establish an everlasting covenant. She shall remember and be ashamed when He is pacified toward her for all that she has done.

## Ezekiel 17: The Eagles and the Vine

The word of the LORD comes in a riddle and parable about a great eagle with great wings who takes the highest branch of a cedar and plants it in a city of merchants. He takes of the seed of the land and plants it by great waters, and it becomes a spreading vine bending toward him. Another great eagle appears, and the vine bends toward him and sends roots toward him. The LORD asks if it will prosper.

He explains that the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took the king and princes and made a covenant with another of the royal seed. Yet he rebels by sending to Egypt for horses and people. The LORD declares he will not escape but die in Babylon. He says He will also take of the highest branch and plant it upon a high mountain of Israel. It will bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a goodly cedar, and all birds will dwell under it. All trees shall know that He is the LORD.

## Ezekiel 18: The Soul That Sins Shall Die

The word of the LORD comes concerning the proverb, "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge." The LORD declares that all souls are His, and the soul that sins shall die. He describes a just man who does what is lawful and right and does not commit idolatry or oppress anyone. That man shall surely live.

If that man has a son who commits violence and sins, that son shall surely die for his iniquity. If that wicked son has a son who sees his father's sins and does not do likewise, he shall live. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked upon him. The LORD calls Israel to repent and turn from transgressions and make a new heart and spirit. He says He has no pleasure in the death of him that dies and calls them to turn and live.

## Ezekiel 19: Lamentation for the Princes of Israel

The LORD commands a lamentation for the princes of Israel. A lioness raises her whelps, and one becomes a young lion who learns to catch prey and devour men. The nations hear of him and take him in their pit and bring him in chains to Egypt. Another whelp becomes a young lion and devours men, and the nations come against him and bring him to the king of Babylon.

The mother is compared to a vine planted by waters that becomes fruitful and strong. But she is plucked up in fury and cast down to the ground. The east wind dries her fruit, and fire consumes her strong rods. Now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground. Fire goes out from a rod of her branches and devours her fruit. This is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation.

## Ezekiel 20: Israel's Rebellion From Egypt Onward

Certain elders of Israel come to inquire of the LORD, and the word of the LORD comes to Ezekiel. The LORD recounts His dealings with Israel in Egypt, when He chose them and made Himself known to them. He tells them to cast away the abominations of their eyes, but they rebel and do not forsake idols. He brings them into the wilderness and gives them statutes and Sabbaths as a sign between Him and them.

They rebel in the wilderness and profane His Sabbaths. He lifts up His hand to scatter them among the nations. He gives them over to statutes that are not good because they polluted themselves with their gifts and caused their sons to pass through the fire. The LORD says He will not be inquired of by them. Yet He declares He will rule over them with a mighty hand and gather them out of the countries. He will purge out rebels and bring them into the bond of the covenant. They shall loathe themselves for their evils and know that He is the LORD.

## Ezekiel 21: The Sword of the LORD

The word of the LORD comes to Ezekiel and tells him to set his face toward Jerusalem and the holy places and to prophesy against the land of Israel. The LORD says He draws His sword out of its sheath and cuts off both the righteous and the wicked. He declares that His sword goes forth against all flesh from the south to the north. Ezekiel is commanded to sigh with a breaking heart and bitter grief before the people. When they ask why he sighs, he answers that it is because of the news that comes and makes every heart melt. The LORD describes a sharpened and polished sword prepared for slaughter and flashing like lightning.

The prophecy speaks of the sword given into the hand of the slayer and calls for striking the thigh in terror. The LORD tells Ezekiel to clap his hands and let the sword strike twice and even three times. He speaks of the king of Babylon standing at the crossroads using divination to choose his path toward Jerusalem. The sword is appointed against the prince of Israel whose day has come in the time of final punishment. The LORD commands the removal of the diadem and crown and says things are overturned until He comes whose right it is. He also speaks against the Ammonites and declares that the same sword of judgment reaches them.

## Ezekiel 22: The Bloody City

The word of the LORD comes and commands Ezekiel to judge the bloody city. Jerusalem is accused of shedding blood in her midst and making idols that defile her. The LORD lists her sins, including dishonoring parents and oppressing the stranger, fatherless, and widow. Princes use their power to shed blood, and priests violate the law and profane holy things. Prophets cover wrongdoing with false visions and lies. The people practice oppression and robbery and mistreat the poor and needy.

The LORD says He looks for a man to stand in the gap before Him for the land but finds none. He declares that He pours out His indignation and consumes them with the fire of His wrath. The house of Israel is compared to dross in the furnace because of their impurity. Silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin are gathered into the furnace to be melted. The LORD says He gathers them into Jerusalem to melt them in His fury. He promises that they shall know that He the LORD has poured out His wrath upon them.

## Ezekiel 23: Oholah and Oholibah

The word of the LORD tells of two women, Oholah and Oholibah, daughters of one mother. Oholah represents Samaria and Oholibah represents Jerusalem. Oholah commits whoredom with the Assyrians and lusts after warriors clothed in blue. She defiles herself with their idols and does not leave her former sins from Egypt. Therefore she is delivered into the hand of her lovers who strip her and slay her with the sword. She becomes a warning to women.

Oholibah sees this yet becomes more corrupt than her sister. She lusts after the Assyrians and then after the Chaldeans portrayed in images. She multiplies her whoredoms and remembers her youth in Egypt. Therefore the LORD stirs up her lovers against her, including the Babylonians and others. They come against her with chariots and weapons and judge her according to their laws. The LORD declares that both sisters bear their lewdness and shall know that He is the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 24: The Boiling Pot and the Death of Ezekiel's Wife

The word of the LORD comes on the day the king of Babylon begins the siege of Jerusalem. Ezekiel is told to set on a pot and pour water into it and gather pieces of meat into it. The pot represents the city and the pieces represent its inhabitants. The LORD declares that the city is a bloody city whose rust remains in it. He commands that it be set empty on the coals so that its impurity may be melted. Yet her great scum does not go out of her.

The LORD tells Ezekiel that his wife, the desire of his eyes, shall die suddenly. He is commanded not to mourn or weep in the usual way but to sigh silently. When his wife dies in the evening, he does as he is commanded. The people ask what this sign means for them. He explains that the LORD will profane the sanctuary, the pride of their strength and the desire of their eyes. They shall do as he does and shall know that He is the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 25: Oracles Against Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia

The word of the LORD comes against the Ammonites because they rejoice when the sanctuary is profaned and the land of Israel is desolate. The LORD says He delivers them to the men of the east for a possession. Their cities become folds for flocks and a resting place for camels. He also speaks against Moab for saying that Judah is like all nations. Therefore He opens the side of Moab and gives it to the same invaders. They shall know that He is the LORD.

The LORD speaks against Edom for taking vengeance and acting in hatred against Judah. He promises to stretch out His hand against Edom and cut off man and beast. He declares that Israel shall lay His vengeance upon Edom. He also speaks against the Philistines for taking revenge with spiteful hearts. He says He executes great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes. They shall know that He is the LORD when He lays His vengeance upon them.

## Ezekiel 26: Oracle Against Tyre

The word of the LORD comes against Tyre because it rejoices over Jerusalem's fall. Tyre says that Jerusalem is broken and now she will be filled. The LORD declares that many nations come up against Tyre like the sea. They destroy her walls and break down her towers. Her dust is scraped from her and she becomes like the top of a rock. She becomes a place for spreading nets.

Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon comes with horses and chariots and a great army. He sets engines of war against the walls and slays with the sword. The daughters in the field are slain and strong pillars fall to the ground. The princes of the sea come down from their thrones and lament over her. They tremble and speak of her former strength in the sea. Tyre becomes a terror and is sought for but never found again.

## Ezekiel 27: Lamentation for Tyre

The word of the LORD commands Ezekiel to take up a lamentation for Tyre. Tyre is described as perfect in beauty and situated at the entry of the sea. Her builders make her ship from fine materials and adorn her with linen and purple. Many nations trade with her and bring silver, iron, tin, lead, horses, ivory, ebony, and precious stones. Merchants from Tarshish, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and others fill her markets. She is filled and made glorious in the midst of the seas.

Yet the east wind breaks her in the midst of the seas. Her riches, wares, mariners, and soldiers fall into the heart of the sea in the day of her ruin. The suburbs shake at the sound of the cry of her pilots. All that handle the oar stand upon the land and lament over her. They cast dust on their heads and cry bitterly. The merchants hiss at her and are astonished. She becomes a terror and never shall be anymore.

## Ezekiel 28: Oracle Against the Prince and King of Tyre

The word of the LORD comes to the prince of Tyre who says in his heart that he is a god. The LORD rebukes him for setting his heart as the heart of God. He says that though he is wise and wealthy, he is a man and not God. Strangers, the terrible of the nations, shall draw their swords against his beauty. He shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers. He shall know that he is a man and not God.

A lamentation is also taken up over the king of Tyre. He is described as full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, in Eden the garden of God. He is adorned with precious stones and walks among fiery stones. Iniquity is found in him and he is cast down from the mountain of God. The LORD speaks against Sidon and promises judgments and pestilence. He declares that Israel shall dwell safely when He gathers them from the nations. They shall know that He is the LORD their God.

## Ezekiel 29: Oracle Against Egypt

In the tenth year the word of the LORD comes against Pharaoh king of Egypt. Pharaoh is likened to a great dragon lying in the midst of his rivers. He says that the river is his and he has made it for himself. The LORD says He puts hooks in his jaws and causes fish to cling to his scales. He draws him out into the wilderness and leaves him there. Egypt becomes desolate for forty years.

The LORD says Egypt has been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. When they lean on it, it breaks and pierces their shoulder. Therefore He brings the sword upon Egypt and scatters its people. After forty years He gathers them but makes them a low kingdom. It shall no longer rule over the nations. They shall know that He is the LORD.

## Ezekiel 30: The Day of the LORD for Egypt

The word of the LORD declares a woe for the day. The day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day for the nations. The sword comes upon Egypt and anguish is in Ethiopia. Her wealth is taken away and her foundations are broken down. Allies like Cush, Lud, and Libya fall with her. The LORD says He strengthens the arms of the king of Babylon.

He breaks the arms of Pharaoh and causes his sword to fall from his hand. The arms of the king of Babylon are strengthened. Egypt is scattered among the nations. The land becomes desolate and waste. Cities are broken down and burned with fire. They shall know that He is the LORD.

## Ezekiel 31: Pharaoh as a Fallen Cedar

The word of the LORD comes to Pharaoh and compares him to Assyria as a cedar in Lebanon. The cedar is beautiful and tall with branches like a forest. Birds nest in its boughs and beasts bring forth under its branches. All great nations dwell under its shadow. Yet its heart is lifted up in its height. Therefore it is delivered into the hand of the mighty one of the nations.

Strangers cut it off and leave it upon the mountains. Its branches fall and peoples depart from its shadow. The LORD causes nations to shake at its fall. Trees of Eden are comforted in the lower parts of the earth. Pharaoh and his multitude are compared to that fallen tree. They lie among the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword.

## Ezekiel 32: Lamentation for Pharaoh

A lamentation is taken up for Pharaoh king of Egypt. He is compared to a young lion and a dragon in the seas who troubles the waters. The LORD spreads His net over him with many people. He casts him upon the land and causes birds and beasts to feed on him. His flesh is laid upon the mountains. The land is watered with his blood.

The nations are made to tremble at his fall. The sword of the king of Babylon comes upon him. Egypt is laid in the midst of the slain with Asshur, Elam, Meshech, Tubal, Edom, and others. They lie with the uncircumcised slain by the sword. Pharaoh sees them and is comforted over his multitude. He lies among the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword. They shall know that He is the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 33: The Watchman and the Fall of Jerusalem

The word of the LORD speaks of the watchman set to warn the people. If the watchman sees the sword and blows the trumpet, he delivers his soul. If he fails to warn, the blood is required at his hand. Ezekiel is appointed as watchman to the house of Israel. He must warn the wicked to turn from their way. If they refuse, they die in their iniquity.

A fugitive comes and announces that the city is smitten. The people speak as though the land is theirs because Abraham was one. The LORD rebukes them for trusting in violence and idolatry. He says the land becomes desolate because of their abominations. The people come to hear Ezekiel as though he sings pleasant songs. Yet they do not do what he says, and they shall know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 34: Shepherds and the One Shepherd

The word of the LORD comes against the shepherds of Israel. They feed themselves and not the flock. They do not strengthen the weak or heal the sick. The sheep are scattered because there is no shepherd. The LORD says He is against the shepherds and requires His flock at their hand. He promises to search for His sheep and deliver them.

He says He sets up one shepherd over them, His servant David. He feeds them and makes a covenant of peace. Evil beasts cease from the land and they dwell safely. The LORD promises showers of blessing. They shall no longer be prey to the nations. They shall know that He the LORD is with them.

## Ezekiel 35: Oracle Against Mount Seir (Edom)

The word of the LORD comes against Mount Seir. It is judged for having perpetual hatred against the children of Israel. Edom sheds their blood in the time of calamity. They say that the two nations and lands shall be theirs. The LORD says He hears their proud words. He prepares them for blood and desolation.

Mount Seir becomes desolate and waste. Its cities are laid waste and none pass through. Because they rejoice at Israel's inheritance, the LORD acts in jealousy. As they rejoiced over Israel's desolation, so He deals with them. They shall know that He is the LORD. The whole earth rejoices when they are made desolate.

## Ezekiel 36: Restoration of the Mountains of Israel

The word of the LORD speaks to the mountains of Israel. They have borne the shame of the nations. The LORD says He speaks in His jealousy against those who seized His land. He promises that the mountains shall shoot forth branches for His people. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places built. The people shall multiply and dwell safely.

The LORD says He does this not for their sake but for His holy name. He sprinkles clean water upon them and gives them a new heart and new spirit. He takes away the stony heart and gives a heart of flesh. They shall walk in His statutes and dwell in the land. The land that was desolate becomes like the garden of Eden. The nations shall know that He the LORD builds the ruined places.

## Ezekiel 37: The Valley of Dry Bones

The hand of the LORD brings Ezekiel to a valley full of dry bones. The LORD asks if these bones can live. Ezekiel prophesies as commanded and there is a noise and shaking. The bones come together and are covered with sinews and flesh. Breath enters them and they stand as a great army. The LORD says these bones are the whole house of Israel.

He promises to open their graves and bring them into the land of Israel. Two sticks representing Judah and Joseph are joined into one in his hand. The LORD declares they shall become one nation with one king. His servant David shall be king over them. He makes a covenant of peace with them. They shall know that He sanctifies Israel when His sanctuary is among them forever.

## Ezekiel 38: The Invasion of Gog

The word of the LORD comes against Gog of the land of Magog. Gog is the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. The LORD says He brings him forth with horses and a great company. Many nations are with him, including Persia, Cush, and Put. They come against the mountains of Israel like a cloud. Gog devises an evil plan to invade a land at rest.

The LORD declares that in the latter days He brings Gog against His land. His fury comes up in His face and there is a great shaking. Mountains are thrown down and walls fall. Every man's sword is against his brother. Pestilence, blood, overflowing rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone fall upon him. The LORD magnifies Himself before the nations.

## Ezekiel 39: The Defeat of Gog

The LORD continues to speak against Gog. He strikes his bow from his left hand and makes his arrows fall. Gog and his multitude fall upon the mountains of Israel. Birds and beasts are called to a great sacrifice feast. The house of Israel burns their weapons for seven years. They bury Gog and cleanse the land for seven months.

The nations know that Israel went into captivity for their iniquity. The LORD says He hides His face from them because of their trespass. Now He has mercy and gathers them from the nations. He pours out His Spirit upon the house of Israel. He leaves none of them captive anymore. They shall know that He is the LORD their God.

## Ezekiel 40: Vision of the New Temple—Measurements

In the twenty-fifth year of captivity, the hand of the LORD brings Ezekiel to the land of Israel in visions. He is set upon a very high mountain where a structure like a city stands. A man with a measuring reed appears. The man measures the gates, courts, and walls. Detailed measurements are given for the outer court and inner court. Chambers and steps are described.

The east, north, and south gates are measured. The porch of the temple is measured with posts and arches. Chambers for singers and priests are shown. The altar area is described. The man measures every part carefully. Ezekiel is told to declare all that he sees to the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 41: The Temple Interior

The man measures the temple itself. The breadth of the doorway and side chambers is recorded. The holy place and the most holy place are described. The walls, doors, and cherubim with palm trees are detailed. The altar of wood stands before the LORD. The dimensions are precise and repeated.

Side chambers around the temple are described in three stories. The thickness of walls and separate place are measured. The doors face north and south. The inner sanctuary is ornamented with cherubim and palm trees. The doors have two leaves apiece. The pattern is consistent throughout the house.

## Ezekiel 42: The Priest's Chambers

The man brings Ezekiel to the chambers opposite the separate place. He measures their length and width. These chambers belong to the priests who approach the LORD. They are holy places for eating the most holy things. When priests enter, they do not go out into the outer court in their holy garments. They lay their garments there for they are holy.

The outer court is measured with a wall around it. The wall separates the holy from the common. The measurements are given in reeds. The four sides are equal in length. The entire area is clearly defined. The distinction between holy and common is emphasized.

## Ezekiel 43: The Glory Returns and the Altar

Ezekiel sees the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice is like many waters and the earth shines with His glory. The glory enters the house by the east gate. The Spirit lifts Ezekiel and brings him into the inner court. The glory of the LORD fills the house. The LORD speaks from the house.

He declares this is the place of His throne. He says Israel shall no more defile His holy name. The altar is described with its measurements and steps. Instructions are given for cleansing the altar. Sacrifices are appointed for seven days. The priests offer offerings and the LORD accepts them.

## Ezekiel 44: The East Gate Shut and Priesthood Regulations

The east gate of the outer sanctuary is shut. The LORD says it is shut because He entered by it. The prince may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD. The glory of the LORD fills the house again. The LORD rebukes Israel for bringing strangers into His sanctuary. The Levites who went astray bear their iniquity.

The sons of Zadok who remain faithful serve in the sanctuary. They come near to minister to the LORD. Regulations are given for their garments and conduct. They teach the people the difference between holy and common. They judge controversies and keep the laws. The LORD is their inheritance.

## Ezekiel 45: Holy Portions and Offerings

A holy portion of land is set apart for the LORD. Portions are assigned for the sanctuary, the priests, and the Levites. The city has its own portion. The prince receives land on both sides of the holy portion. He is warned not to oppress the people. Just weights and measures are commanded.

Offerings are appointed for feasts and sabbaths. The prince provides burnt offerings and peace offerings. The Passover is to be kept in the first month. The feast of the seventh month is also observed. Sin offerings are prescribed for cleansing. The regulations are detailed and precise.

## Ezekiel 46: Worship and the Prince

The gate of the inner court faces east and is shut on working days but opened on the sabbath and new moon. The prince enters by the porch of the gate. He worships at the threshold while the priests prepare offerings. The people worship at the entrance of that gate. The prince provides offerings on appointed days. The order of entering and leaving is regulated.

If the prince gives a gift from his inheritance, it remains his sons' possession. If he gives a gift to a servant, it returns to him in the year of liberty. The prince must not take the people's inheritance by oppression. Kitchens are shown where priests boil offerings. Other kitchens are for the people. The separation of sacred preparation is maintained. All is arranged according to command.

## Ezekiel 47: The River From the Temple

Water flows from under the threshold of the house toward the east. The man measures a thousand cubits and the water reaches the ankles. He measures again and it reaches the knees, then the loins. After another thousand, it is a river that cannot be passed over. The waters go down into the desert and into the sea and are healed. Wherever the river goes, everything lives.

Fishermen stand by the sea and spread nets. The miry places are not healed but given to salt. Trees grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves do not fade and their fruit does not fail. The fruit is for food and the leaves for healing. The borders of the land are described for the tribes of Israel.

## Ezekiel 48: The Tribal Portions and the City

The portions of land for each tribe are listed from north to south. Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, and Judah receive portions. A holy portion lies in the middle for the sanctuary, priests, Levites, and the city. The city has twelve gates named after the tribes of Israel. Three gates are on each side. The measurements of the city are given.

The remaining tribes, Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad, receive their portions. The boundaries of the land are clearly defined. The name of the city from that day is declared. It is called, "The LORD is there." The arrangement shows order and division. The vision concludes with the established name of the city.
