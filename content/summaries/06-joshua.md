# Joshua

## 1: God Commissions Joshua

After the death of Moses, the Lord commissions Joshua to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. God commands him to be strong and courageous, assuring him of success and divine presence, just as He was with Moses. He instructs Joshua to meditate on the Book of the Law day and night and to observe all that is written in it, for then he will be prosperous and successful. Joshua, in turn, commands the officers of the people to prepare for the crossing of the Jordan River within three days. He also reminds the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh of their promise to Moses to help their brethren conquer the land west of the Jordan before returning to their own inheritance on the east side. The people pledge their loyalty to Joshua, promising to obey him as they did Moses and encouraging him to be strong and courageous.

## 2: Rahab and the Spies

Joshua sends two spies from Shittim to secretly scout the land, especially the city of Jericho. They enter the house of a prostitute named Rahab, which is built into the city wall. When the king of Jericho learns of the spies, he sends men to capture them, but Rahab hides them on her roof under stalks of flax. She tells the king's men that the spies have already left and sends them on a false trail. Rahab then reveals to the spies that the people of Jericho are terrified of the Israelites because they have heard of God's mighty acts, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the defeat of the Amorite kings. She professes her faith in the God of Israel and asks the spies to swear an oath to spare her and her family when they attack the city. The spies agree, telling her to hang a scarlet cord in her window as a sign and to gather her entire family inside her house. They then escape from the city by a rope let down from her window and hide in the hills for three days before returning to Joshua. They report that the Lord has indeed given the entire land into their hands and that the people are melting in fear.

## 3: Crossing the Jordan

The Israelites break camp and move to the banks of the Jordan River. After three days, the officers instruct the people to follow the Ark of the Covenant, carried by the Levitical priests, but to keep a distance of about 2,000 cubits. Joshua tells the people to consecrate themselves, for the next day the Lord will do amazing things among them. He announces that the living God is among them and will drive out the inhabitants of the land. As soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touch the water's edge, the Jordan River, which is at flood stage, stops flowing. The water from upstream piles up in a heap a great distance away, and the water flowing down to the Dead Sea is completely cut off. The priests carrying the Ark stand on dry ground in the middle of the riverbed while the entire nation of Israel crosses over on dry ground opposite Jericho.

## 4: Twelve Memorial Stones

After all the Israelites have crossed the Jordan, the Lord commands Joshua to choose twelve men, one from each tribe, to take twelve stones from the middle of the riverbed where the priests are standing. These stones are to be set up at their lodging place that night as a memorial of the miraculous crossing. Joshua also sets up another twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the spot where the priests stood. The twelve stones taken from the river will serve as a sign for future generations, a reminder of how the Lord cut off the flow of the Jordan before the Ark of the Covenant. The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, numbering about 40,000 armed men, cross over ahead of the other Israelites, as they had promised. Once everyone has crossed, the priests carrying the Ark come up out of the river, and as soon as their feet touch the riverbank, the waters of the Jordan return to their place and flow over its banks as before. The people camp at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho, where Joshua sets up the twelve memorial stones.

## 5: Circumcision and Passover at Gilgal

When the Amorite and Canaanite kings west of the Jordan hear that the Lord has dried up the river for the Israelites, their hearts melt with fear. At this time, the Lord commands Joshua to make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again. This is necessary because all the men who had left Egypt had been circumcised, but they had died in the wilderness, and none of the men born during the forty-year journey had been circumcised. After the mass circumcision, the people remain in the camp until they are healed. The Lord declares to Joshua, "This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you," and so the place is named Gilgal. While camped at Gilgal, the Israelites celebrate the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month. The day after the Passover, they eat the produce of the land—unleavened bread and roasted grain. From that day on, the manna ceases, and the Israelites begin to eat the food of Canaan. As Joshua is near Jericho, he sees a man standing before him with a drawn sword. Joshua asks if he is for them or for their enemies, and the man identifies himself as the commander of the Lord's army. Joshua falls facedown in reverence, and the commander tells him to take off his sandals, for the place where he is standing is holy.

## 6: The Fall of Jericho

The city of Jericho is tightly shut up because of the Israelites. The Lord gives Joshua a unique battle plan. For six days, the Israelite army, led by seven priests carrying trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark of the Covenant, is to march around the city once each day. On the seventh day, they are to march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. On the final lap, when the priests sound a long blast on the trumpets, all the people are to shout. When they do, the walls of the city will collapse, and the army is to charge straight in. The Israelites follow these instructions precisely. For six days, they circle the city in silence, except for the sound of the trumpets. On the seventh day, after the seventh circuit, Joshua commands the people to shout, for the Lord has given them the city. The walls of Jericho collapse, and the Israelites rush in and completely destroy the city, killing every living thing in it, except for Rahab and her family, whom the spies rescue as promised. They then burn the city and everything in it, taking only the articles of silver, gold, bronze, and iron for the Lord's treasury. Joshua pronounces a curse on anyone who attempts to rebuild Jericho. The Lord is with Joshua, and his fame spreads throughout the land.

## 7: Achan's Sin

Despite the victory at Jericho, the Israelites suffer a humiliating defeat at the small town of Ai. About thirty-six Israelite soldiers are killed, and the hearts of the people melt in fear. Joshua and the elders of Israel are devastated, and Joshua cries out to the Lord, questioning why He brought them across the Jordan only to be defeated. The Lord reveals that Israel has sinned; someone has violated the ban on taking devoted things from Jericho. This sin has brought judgment upon the entire nation, and they will not be able to stand against their enemies until the devoted things are removed from their midst. God instructs Joshua to consecrate the people and to identify the culprit by a process of elimination, tribe by tribe, clan by clan, family by family, and man by man. The guilty person is to be destroyed by fire, along with all his possessions. The next morning, the process reveals that Achan, from the tribe of Judah, is the one who has sinned. Achan confesses that he coveted a beautiful Babylonian robe, 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold, and took them, burying them in his tent. The items are found and brought before the Lord. Achan, along with his family, his livestock, and all his possessions, is taken to the Valley of Achor, where he and his family are stoned to death and then burned with fire. A large pile of rocks is raised over them as a memorial, and the Lord's fierce anger is turned away.

## 8: The Capture of Ai

The Lord reassures Joshua, telling him not to be afraid and to take the entire army and go up against Ai. This time, God promises them victory and permits them to take the plunder and livestock for themselves. The strategy involves setting an ambush behind the city. Joshua chooses 30,000 of his best soldiers and sends them by night to hide in ambush between Bethel and Ai. The next morning, Joshua and the rest of the army advance on the city. The king of Ai, seeing the Israelites, confidently leads his army out to attack them, drawing them away from the city toward the wilderness, just as before. At Joshua's signal—the raising of his javelin—the men in ambush rise up, rush into the city, and set it on fire. When the men of Ai look back and see the smoke rising from their city, they are trapped, with the main Israelite army before them and the ambush party behind them. The Israelites annihilate the entire population of Ai, about 12,000 people, and hang the king of Ai on a tree until evening. After the victory, Joshua builds an altar to the Lord on Mount Ebal, as Moses had commanded. There, he writes a copy of the law of Moses on stones. With all the Israelites assembled, half in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, Joshua reads all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the Book of the Law.

## 9: The Gibeonite Deception

When the kings of the various Canaanite nations west of the Jordan hear of the Israelites' victories, they form an alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel. However, the people of Gibeon, a large and powerful city, devise a clever strategy to save themselves. They send a delegation to the Israelite camp at Gilgal, disguised as travelers from a distant country. Their donkeys are loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, and they themselves are wearing patched clothes and dry, moldy bread. They tell Joshua and the Israelite leaders that they have come from a faraway land because they have heard of the fame of the Lord and all that He did in Egypt and to the Amorite kings. They ask to make a treaty with the Israelites. The Israelite leaders are suspicious, but they do not consult the Lord. They are deceived by the Gibeonites' appearance and make a treaty with them, swearing an oath to let them live. Three days later, the Israelites discover that the Gibeonites are actually their neighbors. The Israelite army marches to their cities but does not attack them because of the oath. The people grumble against the leaders for being deceived, but the leaders stand by their oath. Instead of destroying the Gibeonites, Joshua curses them and makes them permanent servants of the Israelites, assigned to be woodcutters and water carriers for the house of God.

## 10: The Sun Stands Still

Adoni-Zedek, the king of Jerusalem, learns of the treaty between Gibeon and Israel and becomes alarmed, for Gibeon is a major city. He forms an alliance with four other Amorite kings—the kings of Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—and they march their armies to attack Gibeon. The Gibeonites send an urgent appeal to Joshua for help. Joshua and his entire army march all night from Gilgal to Gibeon. The Lord throws the Amorite armies into a panic, and the Israelites defeat them in a great victory. As the Amorites flee, the Lord hurls large hailstones down on them, killing more of them than the Israelites do with the sword. During the battle, Joshua prays to the Lord, and in the sight of all Israel, he commands the sun to stand still over Gibeon and the moon over the Valley of Aijalon. The sun stands still and the moon stops for about a full day, until the nation of Israel has avenged itself on its enemies. There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the Lord listened to a human being. Joshua and his army then pursue and capture the five kings, who had hidden in a cave. After the victory, Joshua has his commanders put their feet on the necks of the kings before executing them. The Israelites go on to capture and destroy the cities of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir, conquering the entire southern region of Canaan.

## 11: The Northern Conquest

Jabin, the king of Hazor, hears of Israel's victories and forms a massive coalition of northern Canaanite kings, including the kings of Madon, Shimron, and Akshaph, as well as kings from the northern hill country, the Jordan Valley, and the western foothills. They gather their vast armies, with horses and chariots as numerous as the sand on the seashore, at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel. The Lord tells Joshua not to be afraid, for by this time tomorrow, He will hand them all over to Israel, slain. Joshua and his army make a surprise attack on the coalition, and the Lord gives them into the hands of the Israelites. They pursue them and strike them down, leaving no survivors. Joshua hamstrings their horses and burns their chariots, as the Lord had commanded. He then turns back and captures Hazor, the leading kingdom of the coalition, and puts its king to the sword. The Israelites capture all the royal cities of these kings and completely destroy them, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. Joshua conquers the entire land—the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, and the mountain slopes—leaving no survivors and destroying everything that breathed. The land has rest from war.

## 12: List of Defeated Kings

This chapter serves as a summary of the conquests, listing the kings defeated by the Israelites. It begins by listing the two kings on the east side of the Jordan whose land was conquered by Moses: Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan. Their territories were given as an inheritance to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The chapter then lists the thirty-one kings on the west side of the Jordan who were defeated by Joshua and the Israelites. The list includes the kings of Jericho, Ai, Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, Eglon, Gezer, Debir, Geder, Hormah, Arad, Libnah, Adullam, Makkedah, Bethel, Tappuah, Hepher, Aphek, Lasharon, Madon, Hazor, Shimron-Meron, Akshaph, Taanach, Megiddo, Kedesh, Jokneam in Carmel, Dor, the nation of Goyim in Gilgal, and Tirzah. The total number of kings defeated by Joshua and the Israelites west of the Jordan is thirty-one.

## 13–21: Land Allotments

With the major military campaigns complete and the land subdued, the book of Joshua transitions from conquest to the division of the land among the tribes of Israel. Joshua is now old, and the Lord instructs him to begin the process of allotting the territories, even though pockets of Canaanites still remain. The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan River from Moses. For the remaining nine and a half tribes, the land west of the Jordan is divided by lot under the supervision of Joshua, Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the tribal clans.

Caleb, at the age of eighty-five, comes to Joshua and reminds him of the promise Moses made to him forty-five years earlier, to give him the land where he had walked. As a reward for his wholehearted faith, Caleb is given the region of Hebron. The tribe of Judah receives the largest portion of the land in the south. The descendants of Joseph, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, receive their allotments in the central hill country. When the distribution process stalls, Joshua commands the remaining seven tribes to send out a survey party of twenty-one men to map out the rest of the land into seven portions. When they return, Joshua casts lots for them in Shiloh, where the Tabernacle is now located, to determine their inheritance. The tribe of Benjamin receives land between Judah and Ephraim, while Simeon's allotment is within the territory of Judah. The northern tribes of Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali receive their portions, and finally, the tribe of Dan is allotted territory in the west. The Levites do not receive a tribal inheritance of land, as the Lord is their portion; instead, they are given forty-eight cities with their pasturelands, scattered throughout the territories of the other tribes. Six of these cities are designated as cities of refuge, providing a safe haven for anyone who has killed someone accidentally. With the land distributed, the Lord gives Israel rest on every side, just as He had promised. Not one of God's good promises to Israel fails; every one is fulfilled.

## 22: The Altar of Witness

With the land conquered and divided, Joshua blesses the warriors from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh and sends them back to their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. As they travel, they build a large, imposing altar near the Jordan. When the other tribes of Israel hear about this, they are enraged, believing it to be a rival altar for sacrifices, which would be an act of rebellion against God and the central sanctuary at Shiloh. The western tribes gather for war but first send a delegation, led by Phinehas the priest, to confront the eastern tribes. Phinehas accuses them of turning away from the Lord, reminding them of the disastrous consequences of past sins, such as the idolatry at Peor. The eastern tribes earnestly explain that the altar is not for burnt offerings or sacrifices but is intended as a "witness" between them and the western tribes. It is a memorial to future generations that they, too, are part of Israel and have a right to worship the Lord at the Tabernacle. The explanation satisfies Phinehas and the leaders, and a civil war is averted. The eastern tribes name the altar "Witness," for it is a witness between them that the Lord is God.

## 23: Joshua's Farewell Address to the Leaders

After a long period of peace, Joshua, now old and well advanced in years, summons all the leaders of Israel—its elders, heads, judges, and officials. He delivers a farewell address, reminding them of all that the Lord their God has done for them, fighting on their behalf and giving them the land as an inheritance. He exhorts them to be very strong and to be careful to obey everything written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left. Joshua warns them not to associate with the surrounding nations that still remain, not to invoke the names of their gods, and especially not to intermarry with them. He makes it clear that if they violate the covenant and worship other gods, the Lord's anger will burn against them. Just as every good promise of the Lord has been fulfilled, so too will His warnings of judgment come to pass, and they will be driven from the good land He has given them.

## 24: The Covenant Renewal at Shechem

Joshua gathers all the tribes of Israel at Shechem for a final covenant renewal ceremony. He recounts Israel's history from the time of Abraham's ancestors, who lived beyond the Euphrates and worshiped other gods, to their deliverance from Egypt, their journey through the wilderness, and their conquest of the Promised Land. Throughout the narrative, he emphasizes God's sovereign and gracious acts on their behalf. After reminding them of God's faithfulness, Joshua presents the people with a clear choice: "Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve." He declares his own unwavering commitment: "As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord." The people respond with a unified voice, rejecting the gods of their ancestors and the gods of the Amorites, and pledging their allegiance to the Lord, who brought them out of Egypt and performed great signs before their eyes. Joshua makes a covenant with the people that day, setting up a large stone under an oak tree near the holy place of the Lord as a permanent witness to their promises. After this, Joshua dies at the age of 110 and is buried in his inheritance. The high priest Eleazar also dies and is buried. The book concludes by noting that Israel served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the Lord had done for Israel.
