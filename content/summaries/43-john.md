# John

## John 1: The Word Made Flesh and the First Disciples

In the beginning is the Word, and the Word is with God, and the Word is God. All things are made by him, and in him is life, and the life is the light of men. The light shines in darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it. John the Baptist is sent from God to bear witness of the Light. He says he is not the Christ but comes to testify of him. The Word is made flesh and dwells among them, full of grace and truth. John bears witness and says that the one coming after him is preferred before him because he is before him.

Priests and Levites from Jerusalem ask John who he is. He confesses he is not the Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet, but "the voice of one crying in the wilderness." He sees Jesus coming and says, "Behold the Lamb of God." He explains that he baptizes with water but sees the Spirit descending like a dove on Jesus. Two of John's disciples follow Jesus; one is Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. Andrew brings Simon to Jesus, who calls him Cephas, meaning a stone. The next day Jesus calls Philip, and Philip finds Nathanael. Jesus tells Nathanael he sees him under the fig tree, and Nathanael calls him the Son of God and the King of Israel.

## John 2: The Wedding at Cana and the Cleansing of the Temple

At a marriage in Cana of Galilee, Jesus, his mother Mary, and his disciples attend. When the wine fails, Mary tells Jesus. He says his hour is not yet come. He tells the servants to fill six waterpots with water and draw out for the governor of the feast. The water becomes wine, and his disciples believe on him. After this he goes down to Capernaum with his mother, brethren, and disciples.

At Jerusalem during the passover, Jesus finds those selling oxen, sheep, and doves in the temple. He makes a scourge of small cords and drives them out, pours out the changers' money, and overturns the tables. He says, "Make not my Father's house an house of merchandise." The Jews ask for a sign. He answers, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." Many believe when they see his miracles, but he does not commit himself to them because he knows all men.

## John 3: Nicodemus and Born Again

Nicodemus, a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews, comes to Jesus by night and says he knows Jesus is a teacher from God because of the miracles. Jesus tells him that except a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus questions how a man can be born when old. Jesus speaks of being born of water and of the Spirit and says the Son of man must be lifted up, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness. He says God loves the world and sends his Son so that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

Jesus and his disciples come into the land of Judaea and baptize. John also baptizes in Aenon near to Salim. A discussion arises about purifying. John says a man can receive nothing except it be given from heaven and calls himself the friend of the bridegroom. He says he must decrease while Jesus increases. He says the Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.

## John 4: The Woman at the Well and the Nobleman's Son

Jesus leaves Judaea and passes through Samaria. At Jacob's well near Sychar, he speaks with a woman of Samaria. He asks her for water and speaks of living water that becomes a well springing up into everlasting life. He tells her she has had five husbands and now lives with a man not her husband. She speaks of worship in the mountain or in Jerusalem. Jesus says true worshippers worship the Father in spirit and in truth. She says she knows Messias comes; Jesus tells her, "I that speak unto thee am he." She leaves her waterpot and tells the men of the city, and many believe.

A nobleman in Capernaum asks Jesus to heal his son. Jesus tells him to go his way, saying his son lives. The man believes and finds his son healed at the same hour Jesus spoke.

## John 5: The Pool of Bethesda and the Son's Authority

At a feast in Jerusalem, Jesus goes to the pool of Bethesda, where many sick people lie. A man there has an infirmity thirty-eight years. Jesus asks if he wants to be made whole. The man says he has no one to put him into the pool. Jesus tells him to rise, take up his bed, and walk. He is healed on the sabbath. The Jews question him about carrying his bed. When they learn Jesus heals on the sabbath, they seek to slay him. Jesus says his Father works, and he works. He speaks of the Son doing what he sees the Father do and of having authority to execute judgment. He speaks of witnesses to him: John, his works, the Father, and the scriptures.

## John 6: The Bread of Life

Jesus goes over the sea of Galilee. A great multitude follows because of his miracles. He feeds about five thousand with five barley loaves and two small fishes, and twelve baskets remain. The people seek to make him a king, but he withdraws. That evening he walks on the sea to his disciples. They are afraid until he says it is he.

The next day the people seek him. He speaks of the bread of life and says they seek him because they eat the loaves. He says the bread of God comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. He says he is the bread of life and that whoever comes to him will not hunger. He says his flesh is meat indeed and his blood is drink indeed. Many disciples say this is a hard saying and walk no more with him. Jesus asks the twelve if they will also go away. Peter says he has the words of eternal life. Jesus says one of them is a devil, speaking of Judas Iscariot.

## John 7: The Feast of Tabernacles

Jesus walks in Galilee and does not walk openly in Judaea because the Jews seek to kill him. His brethren urge him to show himself at the feast of tabernacles. He goes up in secret. In the temple he teaches, and the Jews marvel at his learning. He says his doctrine is not his own but his that sent him. He speaks of judging righteous judgment. Some say he is the Christ; others question where he comes from. Officers sent to take him return, saying no man ever spoke like this. Nicodemus speaks in his defense, and they answer him with scorn.

## John 8: The Woman Taken in Adultery and I Am

In the temple scribes and Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery and ask Jesus what should be done. Jesus stoops and writes on the ground. He says, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." One by one they leave. Jesus tells the woman he does not condemn her and tells her to sin no more.

He speaks again, saying he is the light of the world. Pharisees challenge his testimony. He speaks of being from above and warns that unless they believe he is he, they will die in their sins. He says the truth shall make them free. They claim Abraham as their father. He says if they were Abraham's children, they would do Abraham's works. He says before Abraham was, "I am." They take up stones to cast at him, but he hides himself.

## John 9: The Man Born Blind

Jesus sees a man blind from birth. His disciples ask who sinned, the man or his parents. Jesus says neither but that the works of God should be made manifest. He makes clay, anoints the man's eyes, and tells him to wash in the pool of Siloam. The man washes and receives sight. Neighbours question how this happens. Pharisees examine him because it is the sabbath. The man says Jesus is a prophet. His parents confirm he is their son but fear the Jews. The man testifies again that Jesus heals him. They cast him out. Jesus finds him and reveals himself as the Son of God. The man worships him. Jesus speaks of judgment, that those who see not might see, and those who see might be made blind.

## John 10: The Good Shepherd

Jesus speaks of the shepherd and the sheep. He says he is the door of the sheep and the good shepherd who gives his life for the sheep. He contrasts the hireling who flees. He says he has other sheep not of this fold and must bring them also. The Jews are divided. At the feast of dedication in Jerusalem, they ask him plainly if he is the Christ. He says his works bear witness. He says, "I and my Father are one." They take up stones to stone him for blasphemy. He answers that scripture calls certain men gods and says the Father sanctifies and sends him. He escapes from their hand and goes beyond Jordan.

## John 11: The Raising of Lazarus

Lazarus of Bethany, the brother of Mary and Martha, is sick. Jesus says the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God. He stays two days and then goes to Judaea. Lazarus has died and is in the grave four days. Martha meets Jesus and says if he had been there, her brother would not have died. Jesus says, "I am the resurrection, and the life." Mary also comes weeping. Jesus weeps. He goes to the grave and commands the stone to be taken away. He calls with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." Lazarus comes out bound in graveclothes. Many believe, but some tell the Pharisees. The chief priests and Pharisees take counsel to put him to death. Caiaphas says it is expedient that one man should die for the people. Jesus no longer walks openly but goes to Ephraim.

## John 12: Mary Anoints Jesus and the Triumphal Entry

At Bethany, Mary anoints Jesus' feet with ointment and wipes them with her hair. Judas Iscariot objects, speaking of the poor. Jesus says she keeps it for his burial. Chief priests consult to put Lazarus also to death because many believe because of him. Jesus enters Jerusalem riding on a young ass, and the people cry, "Hosanna." Greeks come desiring to see Jesus. He speaks of a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying. A voice from heaven answers him. He says when he is lifted up, he will draw all men to him. Many rulers believe but do not confess openly. He cries that whoever believes in him believes in the one who sent him.

## John 13: The Last Supper and Washing Feet

Before the feast of the passover, Jesus washes the disciples' feet. Peter at first refuses, but Jesus says unless he washes him, he has no part with him. Jesus says one of them will betray him. He gives a sop to Judas Iscariot, and Satan enters into him. Judas goes out. Jesus gives a new commandment, that they love one another as he loves them. Peter says he will lay down his life, but Jesus says the cock will not crow till Peter denies him three times.

## John 14: The Way, the Truth, and the Life

Jesus tells his disciples not to let their heart be troubled and says he goes to prepare a place for them. Thomas asks how they can know the way. Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." Philip asks to see the Father, and Jesus says whoever has seen him has seen the Father. He promises the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in his name. He says he gives them peace, not as the world gives. He says the prince of this world comes and has nothing in him.

## John 15: The Vine and the Branches

Jesus says he is the true vine, and his Father is the husbandman. He speaks of branches that bear fruit and those that are taken away. He tells his disciples to abide in him. He commands them to love one another. He says if the world hates them, it hates him first. He says the Comforter will testify of him, and they also will bear witness.

## John 16: The Comforter and Tribulation

Jesus tells his disciples they will face persecution and that some will think they do God service by killing them. He says he goes away so the Comforter will come. He speaks of the Spirit reproving the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He says he has many things to say but they cannot bear them now. He says their sorrow will turn to joy. He tells them they will have tribulation in the world but should be of good cheer because he overcomes the world.

## John 17: The High Priestly Prayer

Jesus lifts up his eyes to heaven and prays. He speaks of having finished the work given to him and asks to be glorified with the glory he had before the world was. He prays for his disciples, that they may be kept from evil and be one. He also prays for those who will believe through their word, that they all may be one and behold his glory. He says he declares the Father's name and will declare it.

## John 18: The Arrest and Trial Before Pilate

Jesus goes with his disciples over the brook Cedron into a garden. Judas Iscariot comes with officers and soldiers. Jesus steps forward and says, "I am he," and they fall backward. He is bound and taken first to Annas, then to Caiaphas. Peter denies him three times. They bring Jesus to Pilate. Pilate asks if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus speaks of a kingdom not of this world. Pilate says he finds no fault in him but offers to release him at the passover. The crowd chooses Barabbas.

## John 19: The Crucifixion and Burial

Pilate has Jesus scourged. Soldiers plait a crown of thorns and put a purple robe on him. Pilate says, "Behold the man." The chief priests cry out to crucify him. Pilate delivers him to be crucified. He carries his cross to Golgotha, where he is crucified with two others. The title over him reads, Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. Soldiers cast lots for his coat. Jesus speaks to his mother and to the disciple whom he loves. He says, "It is finished," and bows his head. Soldiers pierce his side, and blood and water come out. Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus lay him in a new sepulchre.

## John 20: The Resurrection and Thomas

Mary Magdalene comes early to the sepulchre and sees the stone taken away. She runs to Simon Peter and the other disciple. They run to the tomb and see the linen clothes lying. They return home. Mary stands outside weeping. She sees two angels and then turns and sees Jesus but does not recognize him until he speaks her name. He tells her not to touch him but to go to his brethren. That evening Jesus appears to the disciples, shows his hands and side, and says, "Peace be unto you." Thomas is not present and later says he will not believe unless he sees and touches. Eight days later Jesus appears again and tells Thomas to reach his hand. Thomas answers, "My Lord and my God."

## John 21: The Breakfast by the Sea and Peter Restored

Jesus shows himself again at the sea of Tiberias to Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples. They fish all night and catch nothing. Jesus stands on the shore and tells them to cast the net on the right side. They catch a great multitude of fishes. On shore he has bread and fish and eats with them. He asks Peter three times, "Lovest thou me?" and tells him to feed his sheep. He speaks of Peter's future and of the disciple whom Jesus loves. The chapter ends saying many other things are done by Jesus, which are not written in the book.
