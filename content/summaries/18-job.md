# Job

## Job 1: Job's Integrity and First Test

Job lives in the land of Uz and is known for fearing God and turning away from evil. He has seven sons, three daughters, and great wealth. His sons hold feasts in their homes, and Job regularly sends for them and offers burnt offerings in case any of them sins in their hearts.

God's sons present themselves, and Satan comes among them. God points out Job's integrity, and Satan argues that Job fears God only because he is protected and blessed. God allows Satan to touch what Job owns but not Job himself. Raiders steal Job's oxen and asses and kill servants; fire consumes sheep and servants; Chaldeans take camels and kill servants; a great wind collapses the house where Job's children are, and they all die. Job tears his robe, shaves his head, falls down, and worships. He says he comes into the world with nothing and leaves with nothing, and he does not charge God with wrong.

## Job 2: Satan Strikes Job's Body; Friends Arrive

God's sons present themselves again, and Satan appears. God again points to Job's integrity, and Satan claims Job will give anything to save his own life. God allows Satan to touch Job's body but not take his life. Job is struck with painful boils from head to foot. He sits among ashes and scrapes himself with a piece of broken pottery.

Job's wife tells him to curse God and die, but Job refuses and says they should accept both good and trouble from God. Job's three friends—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—hear what happens and come to mourn with him. They see Job from a distance, weep, tear their robes, and sit with him on the ground for seven days and nights without speaking because his grief is so great.

## Job 3: Job Curses the Day of His Birth

Job opens his mouth and curses the day of his birth. He wishes he had died at birth, asks why life is given to people in misery, and describes his restless suffering and fear.

## Job 4–14: First Cycle of Dialogue

Eliphaz tells Job that he has helped others before, but now he collapses under his own trouble. He argues that the innocent do not perish without cause and describes a night vision that stresses human weakness and impurity. He says God corrects and wounds but also heals, and he urges Job to seek God, accept correction, and expect restoration.

Job answers that his grief is heavier than words and that his pain is sharp and unrelenting. He asks his friends for loyal support, not accusations. He describes life as hard service and nights of misery, says his days pass quickly, and speaks to God about being watched and worn down, asking why he is a target and when relief will come.

Bildad insists God does not twist justice. He claims Job's children die for their wrongdoing and says that if Job is pure and upright, God will wake for him and restore him. He points to traditional wisdom and says the hope of the godless will fail.

Job agrees that no one can be proven right before God and describes God's unmatched power. He says a person cannot answer God in court, even if innocent. Job speaks of feeling crushed without knowing why, then pleads with God: God forms him, yet now seems to destroy him. He asks why he is brought into life only to suffer and begs for a little comfort before he dies.

Zophar rebukes Job for talking too much and claims Job's guilt deserves more punishment than he receives. He says God's wisdom is beyond reach and urges Job to prepare his heart, put away sin, and then lift up his face without fear.

Job responds with sharp sarcasm, saying his friends act like they own wisdom. He insists he is not inferior to them and points out that trouble often comes to those who do right while the wicked can seem secure. He says all creatures show that God gives and takes away life. Job describes God's control over leaders and nations, then says he wants to speak directly to God, not to "healers" who offer empty words. He asks God to let him know the charges against him, and he reflects on human mortality: a person dies and does not rise in this life. He asks God to hide him in the grave until anger passes, and he laments that hope fades like a worn-out thing.

## Job 15–21: Second Cycle of Dialogue

Eliphaz accuses Job of answering with empty words and claims Job's own mouth condemns him. He argues that suffering fits the wicked and describes the terrors and collapse that come to an evil person.

Job calls his friends miserable comforters and says their words only increase pain. He says God breaks him apart and makes him a public target. Yet he insists he has not committed violence and that his prayer is pure. He longs for someone to stand up for him with God, since his life feels near the grave and his hopes are being pulled down.

Bildad attacks Job's understanding and paints a vivid picture of a wicked person trapped by fear and disaster. He says the wicked person's light goes out, his strength fails, and he is driven from security to ruin, and his memory disappears.

Job says his friends crush him and keep shaming him. He claims God blocks his path and strips his honor. He describes being abandoned by relatives, friends, servants, and even his wife. He begs for pity because he feels God's hand strikes him. He speaks of wanting his words preserved and declares confidence that his redeemer lives and that he will see God.

Zophar argues that the joy of the wicked is brief and that pride ends quickly. He describes evil as sweet in the mouth but turning bitter inside, and says the wicked person may gain riches but will not keep them. He insists judgment catches up and ends the wicked person's legacy.

Job asks his friends to listen quietly and let him speak. He challenges their claims by pointing to the fact that the wicked often live long, grow strong, and see their children prosper. They avoid God, yet they seem safe. Job says disaster is not always immediate and argues that people cannot teach God how to judge, since both the comfortable and the suffering die and lie down alike.

## Job 22–31: Third Cycle and Job's Final Defense

Eliphaz accuses Job of specific wrongdoing: taking pledges unfairly, stripping the poor, withholding water and bread, and sending widows away empty. He claims Job's view of God is wrong and says Job thinks God cannot see. He urges Job to agree with God, return to the Almighty, put away injustice, and then be restored and protected.

Job says his complaint continues and that he wants to find God's court and present his case. He describes searching in every direction but not finding God, while still believing God knows his way. He says he fears God's power. He then lists wrongs he sees: boundaries moved, the poor abused, the needy pushed aside, the helpless forced into harsh labor, and thieves and violent people operating in darkness. He says wrongdoing can be hidden for a time and that judgment is not always visible right away.

Bildad gives a short speech about God's rule and fearsome power. He says a human cannot be clean before God and that even the stars are not pure compared to God, so a person is even less.

Job responds that Bildad offers no real help and then describes God's power over the unseen depths, the sea, clouds, and the skies. Job insists he will not admit wrongdoing he does not have. He says he will hold to his integrity while he lives. He then describes the final portion of the wicked: children fall, wealth does not last, and fear overtakes them.

A poem describes how people mine the earth for hidden treasures, but wisdom cannot be mined, bought, or weighed against gold and jewels. It says only God understands the way to wisdom and knows its place, and that fearing the Lord and turning from evil is wisdom.

Job remembers his former life: respect from leaders, help to the poor, care for widows and the fatherless, guidance to those who did not know what to do, and a sense of security. He then contrasts it with his present shame: younger men mock him, he is treated as an outcast, and he feels God's arrows and terrors. He describes his body's pain and sleepless misery.

Job lists examples of integrity he claims: he avoids lust and deceit, refuses to rejoice at an enemy's harm, welcomes strangers, does not trust wealth, does not worship the sun or moon, and does not hide wrongdoing. He speaks of helping the needy and not using power to crush the fatherless. He ends by calling for an answer from the Almighty and for his accuser's written charges, saying he is ready to face them openly.

## Job 32–37: Elihu's Speeches

Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite begins speaking after Job's three friends stop answering. Elihu is angry because Job claims righteousness over against God and because the friends fail to refute him. He explains that he is young but believes understanding comes from God's breath, not age alone.

Elihu tells Job that God is greater than a person and does not have to answer human demands. He argues that God speaks in different ways, including dreams and suffering, to turn a person from ruin. He challenges Job's statements and says it is wrong to claim God acts unjustly. He insists God repays people according to their ways and never does wrong. He urges Job to listen and says suffering can be a form of correction that calls someone back from disaster. Elihu then describes God's greatness shown in creation and weather—thunder, rain, snow, ice, wind, and the ordering of the world—and he calls on Job to consider these works and recognize God's unmatched power.

## Job 38–41: God's Answer

The LORD answers Job out of a whirlwind and questions him about the creation and ordering of the world. God asks where Job is when the earth's foundations are laid, who sets its measurements, and how light, darkness, and the sea are bounded. God asks about storehouses of snow and hail, the paths of lightning, and the courses of stars and constellations. God questions Job about providing for animals and governing their instincts, including lions, ravens, wild goats, deer, wild donkeys, oxen, ostriches, horses, hawks, and eagles.

Job gives a brief reply that he is small and puts his hand over his mouth. God continues, challenging Job about justice and power and asks whether Job can humble the proud and judge the wicked. God then describes Behemoth, a powerful creature with great strength, and Leviathan, a fearsome creature that cannot be easily captured or controlled. God's questions press the point that these works and creatures are beyond Job's control.

## Job 42: Job Repents and Is Restored

Job answers the LORD and admits God can do everything and that no plan of God can be stopped. Job says he speaks without understanding about things too wonderful for him. He repents in dust and ashes.

The LORD tells Eliphaz that God's anger burns against him and his two friends because they do not speak what is right about God, as Job does. God tells them to offer burnt offerings, and Job prays for them, and God accepts Job. The LORD restores Job's fortunes and gives him twice as much as before. Job's brothers, sisters, and former acquaintances come, eat with him, comfort him, and give him money and earrings. Job receives more livestock than before and has seven sons and three daughters; the daughters are named Jemima, Kezia, and Keren-happuch, and they receive an inheritance along with their brothers. Job lives many more years, sees multiple generations of his descendants, and dies old and full of days.
