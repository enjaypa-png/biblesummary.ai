## Daniel 1: Daniel and His Friends in Babylon

In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon comes unto Jerusalem and besieges it. The Lord gives Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carries into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. The king speaks unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; children in whom is no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as have ability in them to stand in the king's palace, whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. The king appoints them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank, so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. Among these are of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The prince of the eunuchs gives them names: unto Daniel he gives the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.

Daniel purposes in his heart that he will not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank. He requests of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. The prince of the eunuchs fears his lord the king, who has appointed their meat and drink, lest he should see their faces worse liking than the children of their sort, and thus endanger his head to the king. Daniel then speaks to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs has set over them, and proposes a test of ten days. He asks that they be given pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let their countenances be looked upon, and as the guard sees, he should deal with his servants. Melzar consents, and at the end of ten days their countenances appear fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. Thus Melzar takes away the portion of their meat and gives them pulse. As for these four children, God gives them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom, and Daniel has understanding in all visions and dreams. At the end of the days, the prince of the eunuchs brings them in before Nebuchadnezzar. The king communes with them, and among them all is found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they stand before the king. In all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king enquires of them, he finds them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that are in all his realm.

## Daniel 2: Nebuchadnezzar's Dream

In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar dreams dreams, wherewith his spirit is troubled, and his sleep breaks from him. He commands the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to be called to shew the king his dreams. The king tells them he has dreamed a dream and his spirit is troubled to know it. The Chaldeans speak to the king in Syriack, asking him to tell his servants the dream, and they will shew the interpretation. The king answers that the thing is gone from him; if they will not make known unto him the dream, with the interpretation thereof, they shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill. But if they shew the dream and its interpretation, they shall receive gifts and rewards and great honour. They answer again, asking the king to tell them the dream. The king knows of a certainty that they would gain the time, because they see the thing is gone from him. The Chaldeans answer that there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter. For this cause the king is angry and very furious, and commands to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. The decree goes forth that the wise men should be slain, and they seek Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

Daniel answers with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard. He asks why the decree is so hasty from the king. Arioch makes the thing known to Daniel, who then desires of the king that he would give him time to shew the interpretation. Daniel goes to his house and makes the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret. The secret is revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Daniel goes unto Arioch and tells him not to destroy the wise men of Babylon, but to bring him before the king. The king asks Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, if he is able to make known the dream and its interpretation. Daniel answers that the secret which the king has demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets. He tells the king he saw a great image, whose brightness was excellent, and the form thereof was terrible. The image's head is of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. A stone is cut out without hands, which smites the image upon his feet and breaks them to pieces. Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold are broken to pieces together, and become like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors. The stone that smote the image becomes a great mountain, and fills the whole earth. Daniel explains that the king is this head of gold. After him shall arise another kingdom inferior to his, and a third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron. And whereas the king saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed. Then King Nebuchadnezzar falls upon his face, and worships Daniel, and says that of a truth, his God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets. The king makes Daniel a great man, and ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. At Daniel's request, the king sets Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel sits in the gate of the king.

## Daniel 3: The Fiery Furnace

King Nebuchadnezzar makes an image of gold, whose height is threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits, and sets it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. He gathers together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image. An herald cries aloud that at what time they hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, they shall fall down and worship the golden image. And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

Certain Chaldeans come near and accuse the Jews. They speak to the king that there are certain Jews whom he has set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. In his rage and fury, Nebuchadnezzar commands them to be brought. He asks if it is true, and gives them one more chance. They answer that their God whom they serve is able to deliver them from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver them out of his hand. But if not, be it known unto the king, that they will not serve his gods, nor worship the golden image. Then is Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage is changed against them. He commands that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated, and commands the most mighty men in his army to bind them and cast them into the furnace. The flame of the fire slays those men that took them up. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fall down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king is astonied, and rises up in haste, and asks his counsellors if they did not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire. They answer that it is true. The king says, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. Nebuchadnezzar comes near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and calls for them to come forth. They come forth, and the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, see these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. Then Nebuchadnezzar speaks, and says, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him. He makes a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against their God, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. Then the king promotes Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

## Daniel 4: Nebuchadnezzar's Dream of a Tree

King Nebuchadnezzar, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. He thinks it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward him. He recounts a dream which made him afraid. He calls in all the wise men of Babylon to make known unto him the interpretation, but they could not. But at the last Daniel comes in, and the king tells him the dream. He saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all. The beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof. He saw in the visions of his head upon his bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit. Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth. Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, is astonied for one hour, and his thoughts trouble him. He tells the king that the tree is the king, who is grown and become strong. The decree of the most High means that the king shall be driven from men, and his dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make him to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet him with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over him, till he knows that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; his kingdom shall be sure unto him, after that he shall have known that the heavens do rule. Daniel counsels the king to break off his sins by righteousness, and his iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor. All this comes upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months he walks in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon, and speaks, saying, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? While the word is in the king's mouth, there falls a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. The same hour is the thing fulfilled upon him, and he is driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body is wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs are grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. At the end of the days, he, Nebuchadnezzar, lifts up his eyes unto heaven, and his understanding returns unto him, and he blesses the most High. His honour and brightness returned unto him; and his counsellors and his lords sought unto him; and he was established in his kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto him. Now he praises and extols and honours the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment.

## Daniel 5: The Writing on the Wall

Belshazzar the king, son of Nebuchadnezzar, makes a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drinks wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he tastes the wine, commands to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. Then they praise the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

In the same hour come forth fingers of a man's hand, and write over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king sees the part of the hand that wrote. The king's countenance is changed, and his thoughts trouble him, so that the joints of his loins are loosed, and his knees smite one against another. The king cries aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. He promises that whosoever shall read this writing, and shew him the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. Then come in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. Then is King Belshazzar greatly troubled. Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, comes into the banquet house. She tells the king there is a man in his kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of his father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him. This Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts. Daniel is brought in before the king, who offers him the same rewards. Daniel answers that the king should let his gifts be to himself, and give his rewards to another; yet he will read the writing. He reminds the king of how God gave his father Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour, but when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne. And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven. Thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified. Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written. This is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. Then Belshazzar commands, and they clothe Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and make a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. In that night is Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median takes the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.

## Daniel 6: Daniel in the Den of Lions

It pleases Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel is first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. Then this Daniel is preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit is in him; and the king thinks to set him over the whole realm. Then the presidents and princes seek to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he is faithful. Then say these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.

Then these presidents and princes assemble together to the king, and propose that he establish a royal statute, and make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of the king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. King Darius signs the writing and the decree. Now when Daniel knows that the writing is signed, he goes into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneels upon his knees three times a day, and prays, and gives thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. Then these men assemble, and find Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. They come before the king, and speak concerning the king's decree. The king confirms that the thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Then they tell the king that Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not the king, nor the decree that he has signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. When the king hears these words, he is sore displeased with himself, and sets his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labours till the going down of the sun to deliver him. Then these men assemble unto the king, and say that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. Then the king commands, and they bring Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king speaks and says unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. A stone is brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king seals it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. Then the king goes to his palace, and passes the night fasting: neither are instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep goes from him. Then the king arises very early in the morning, and goes in haste unto the den of lions. And when he comes to the den, he cries with a lamentable voice unto Daniel, asking if his God, whom he serves continually, is able to deliver him from the lions. Then says Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. Then is the king exceedingly glad for him, and commands that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel is taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt is found upon him, because he believed in his God. And the king commands, and they bring those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions have the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. Then king Darius writes unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth, making a decree, That in every dominion of his kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

## Daniel 7: Vision of the Four Beasts

In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel has a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. He writes the dream, and tells the sum of the matters. He sees in his vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts come up from the sea, diverse one from another. The first is like a lion, and has eagle's wings: he beholds till the wings thereof are plucked, and it is lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart is given to it. And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raises up itself on one side, and it has three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. After this he beholds, and lo another, like a leopard, which has upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast has also four heads; and dominion is given to it. After this he sees in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it has great iron teeth: it devours and breaks in pieces, and stamps the residue with the feet of it: and it is diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it has ten horns. He considers the horns, and, behold, there comes up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn are eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

Daniel beholds till the thrones are cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment is white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne is like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issues and comes forth from before him: thousand thousands minister unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before him: the judgment is set, and the books are opened. He beholds then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: he beholds even till the beast is slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they have their dominion taken away: yet their lives are prolonged for a season and time. He sees in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man comes with the clouds of heaven, and comes to the Ancient of days, and they bring him near before him. And there is given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. Daniel is grieved in his spirit, and the visions of his head trouble him. He comes near unto one of them that stood by, and asks him the truth of all this. He is told that these great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. Daniel would know the truth of the fourth beast, and of the ten horns, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell. He is told that the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms. And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

## Daniel 8: Vision of the Ram and the He-Goat

In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appears unto Daniel. He is at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and he is by the river of Ulai. He lifts up his eyes, and sees, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which has two horns: and the two horns are high; but one is higher than the other, and the higher came up last. He sees the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither is there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. As he is considering, behold, an he goat comes from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat has a notable horn between his eyes. He comes to the ram that has two horns and runs unto him in the fury of his power. He comes close unto the ram, and is moved with choler against him, and smites the ram, and breaks his two horns: and there is no power in the ram to stand before him, but he casts him down to the ground, and stamps upon him. Therefore the he goat waxes very great: and when he is strong, the great horn is broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. And out of one of them comes forth a little horn, which waxes exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxes great, even to the host of heaven; and it casts down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamps upon them. Yea, he magnifies himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the place of his sanctuary is cast down.

Then Daniel hears one saint speaking, and another saint says unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he is told, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. When Daniel has seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before him as the appearance of a man. And he hears a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. Gabriel comes near where Daniel stood, and Daniel is afraid, and falls upon his face. But Gabriel tells him to understand, for at the time of the end shall be the vision. He explains that the ram which he saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. And in the latter time of their kingdom, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. The vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. And Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward he rose up, and did the king's business; and he was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.

## Daniel 9: Daniel's Prayer and the Seventy Weeks

In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, Daniel understands by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. And he sets his face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes. He prays unto the Lord his God, and makes his confession, saying that they have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from God's precepts and from his judgments. Neither have they hearkened unto his servants the prophets. He says, O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day. He asks the Lord, according to all his righteousness, to let his anger and his fury be turned away from his city Jerusalem, his holy mountain. He pleads for God to cause his face to shine upon his sanctuary that is desolate.

Whiles Daniel is speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom he had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touches him about the time of the evening oblation. He informs him and says that at the beginning of his supplications the commandment came forth, and he is come to shew him; for he is greatly beloved. He tells Daniel to understand the matter, and consider the vision: Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

## Daniel 10: Vision of a Man by the River

In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing is revealed unto Daniel; and the thing is true, but the time appointed is long. Daniel mourns three full weeks. He eats no pleasant bread, neither comes flesh nor wine in his mouth, neither did he anoint himself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. In the four and twentieth day of the first month, as he is by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, he lifts up his eyes, and looks, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins are girded with fine gold of Uphaz. His body also is like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

Daniel alone sees the vision: for the men that are with him saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. Therefore he is left alone, and sees this great vision, and there remained no strength in him. Yet he hears the voice of his words: and when he hears the voice of his words, then is he in a deep sleep on his face, and his face toward the ground. And, behold, an hand touches him, which sets him upon his knees and upon the palms of his hands. The man tells him that he is a man greatly beloved, and that he should understand the words that he speaks. He says that from the first day that Daniel did set his heart to understand, and to chasten himself before his God, his words were heard, and he is come for his words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood him one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help him. Now he is come to make Daniel understand what shall befall his people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. When he has spoken such words, Daniel sets his face toward the ground, and he becomes dumb. And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touches his lips: then he opens his mouth, and speaks. He says his sorrow is turned upon him, and he has retained no strength. Then there came again and touched him one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened him. He tells Daniel, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. He says that he will shew him that which is noted in the scripture of truth. He says he will return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when he is gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

## Daniel 11: The Kings of the South and the North

The man clothed in linen continues to speak. He says he will shew Daniel the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled. The king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion. And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail. And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold. The king of the north shall come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land. But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through. Then shall the king of the south be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand. The king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches. And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall. So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand. He that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him. After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease. Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found. Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people. He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches. He shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time. And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him. The two kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant. At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant. And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate. And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished. Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: a god whom his fathers knew not. At the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. He shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

## Daniel 12: The Time of the End

And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.

Then Daniel looks, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? And Daniel hears the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. And Daniel heard, but he understood not: then said he, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
