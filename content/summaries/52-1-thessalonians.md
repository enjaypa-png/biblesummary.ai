# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1: Thanksgiving and Their Example

Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus greet the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ, speaking of grace and peace. Paul gives thanks for their work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope. He says the gospel comes to them not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost. They become followers of Paul and of the Lord, receiving the word in affliction with joy. Their example spreads through Macedonia and Achaia, and others report how they turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his Son from heaven, Jesus, whom God raises from the dead.

## 1 Thessalonians 2: Paul's Ministry Among Them

Paul reminds them that his coming is not in vain. Though he suffers before at Philippi, he speaks boldly at Thessalonica. He says his message is not from deceit or uncleanness, and he does not seek glory from men. He is gentle among them, laboring night and day so as not to burden anyone. He exhorts and comforts them as a father does his children, urging them to walk worthy of God. He thanks God that they receive the word as it is in truth, the word of God. He says they suffer from their own countrymen as the churches in Judaea suffer from the Jews. He desires to see them but says Satan hinders him, calling them his joy at the coming of the Lord Jesus.

## 1 Thessalonians 3: Timothy's Visit and Paul's Prayer

Paul sends Timotheus, his brother and minister of God, to establish and comfort them in their faith. He reminds them that they are appointed to afflictions. Timotheus returns with good news of their faith and charity and says they remember Paul kindly and desire to see him. Paul says he is comforted in his distress by their faith and prays night and day to see them and perfect what is lacking in their faith. He asks God to increase their love and establish their hearts blameless at the coming of the Lord Jesus.

## 1 Thessalonians 4: Holiness and the Rapture

He urges them to abound more and more in pleasing God and to abstain from fornication. He says God calls them to holiness, not uncleanness. He tells them to love one another, to live quietly, do their own business, and work with their hands. Concerning those who sleep, he says they are not to sorrow as others. He declares that the Lord descends from heaven with a shout, the dead in Christ rise first, and those alive are caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

## 1 Thessalonians 5: The Day of the Lord and Final Exhortations

He says the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night. While people say peace and safety, sudden destruction comes. He calls them children of light and urges them to watch and be sober. He says God appoints them to obtain salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ. He instructs them to respect those who labor among them, warn the unruly, comfort the weak, rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in everything, prove all things, and abstain from every appearance of evil. Paul asks for prayer, commands that the epistle be read to all the brethren, and closes with grace.
