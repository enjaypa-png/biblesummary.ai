## 1 Corinthians 1: Greeting, Thanksgiving, and Divisions

Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, address the church of God at Corinth. He speaks to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be saints, along with all who call on the name of Jesus Christ. He thanks God for the grace given to them and says they are enriched in speech and knowledge, lacking no spiritual gift as they wait for the coming of the Lord.

Paul reports that Chloe's household has told him about divisions among them. Some claim allegiance to Paul, others to Apollos, others to Cephas, and others to Christ. Paul asks whether Christ is divided and reminds them that he baptizes only a few of them, including Crispus and Gaius. He declares that Christ sends him to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom. He explains that the message of the cross is foolishness to those who perish but is the power of God to those who are saved. He reminds them that God chooses what the world considers foolish and weak to bring down what is wise and strong, so that no one boasts before Him.

## 1 Corinthians 2: The Spirit of Wisdom

Paul says he comes to Corinth not with excellence of speech but declaring Jesus Christ and Him crucified. He admits he is with them in weakness and fear, and his preaching relies not on persuasive words of human wisdom but on the demonstration of the Spirit and power. He wants their faith to rest in God's power.

He speaks of wisdom revealed by God, hidden before the world began. He says the rulers of this world do not understand it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. He declares that God reveals these things through His Spirit, who searches all things. Paul explains that spiritual truths are understood through the Spirit, and the natural man does not receive them because they are spiritually discerned.

## 1 Corinthians 3: God's Building and Servants

Paul calls the believers carnal, unable to receive solid spiritual teaching because of jealousy and division among them. He says he plants and Apollos waters, but God gives the increase. Both are servants working together, and the Corinthians are God's field and building.

He describes Christ as the foundation and warns that each person's work will be tested by fire. If the work endures, there is reward; if it burns, the person suffers loss but is saved. He tells them they are God's temple and that destroying it brings judgment. He urges them not to boast in men because all things belong to them, and they belong to Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 4: Stewards and Fathers in Christ

Paul urges them to regard him and others as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries. He says it is a small thing for him to be judged by them, for the Lord judges him. He warns them not to judge before the time until the Lord reveals hidden things.

He contrasts their self-confidence with the apostles' suffering. He describes the apostles as hungry, beaten, homeless, and made a spectacle to the world. He calls himself their father through the gospel and urges them to imitate him. He sends Timothy to remind them of his ways in Christ and warns that he will come with discipline if necessary.

## 1 Corinthians 5: Sexual Immorality and Church Discipline

Paul confronts a report of sexual immorality among them, involving a man with his father's wife. He rebukes their pride and commands them to remove the offender from their fellowship. He instructs them to deliver such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that the spirit may be saved.

He compares sin to leaven that spreads through dough and urges them to purge out the old leaven. He clarifies that they are not to associate with anyone called a brother who lives in immorality, greed, idolatry, drunkenness, or extortion. He tells them to judge those inside the church and leave outsiders to God.

## 1 Corinthians 6: Lawsuits and Flee Fornication

Paul rebukes them for taking disputes before unbelieving courts instead of resolving matters among themselves. He reminds them that the saints will judge the world and even angels. He says it is better to suffer wrong than to defraud one another.

He lists various wrongdoers who will not inherit the kingdom of God, including fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, and drunkards. He reminds them that some of them once lived this way but are washed and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of God. He warns them that their bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost and urges them to flee fornication.

## 1 Corinthians 7: Marriage and Singleness

Paul responds to matters they write about, including marriage. He says it is good for a man not to touch a woman, yet because of immorality, each should have his own spouse. He instructs husbands and wives not to deprive one another and not to separate unless by mutual consent.

He addresses unmarried people, widows, and those married to unbelievers. He encourages each person to remain in the calling in which they are called. He says the time is short and advises believers to live with an eternal perspective, free from anxious care.

## 1 Corinthians 8: Food Offered to Idols

Paul discusses food offered to idols. He acknowledges that idols are nothing and that there is one God, the Father, and one Lord, Jesus Christ. Yet not all believers have this knowledge.

He warns that exercising freedom without love can cause a weaker brother to stumble. He says that if food causes his brother to fall, he will never eat meat again.

## 1 Corinthians 9: Paul's Rights as an Apostle

Paul defends his apostleship and reminds them that he has the right to receive support, though he does not use that right. He works with his own hands and preaches freely.

He says he becomes all things to all men to save some. He compares the Christian life to a race and boxing match, disciplining his body so that after preaching to others he himself is not disqualified.

## 1 Corinthians 10: Warnings from Israel's History

Paul recalls Israel's history, including their passage through the sea under Moses and their participation in spiritual food and drink. Many fall in the wilderness because of idolatry, immorality, and complaining.

He warns the Corinthians not to repeat these sins. He speaks about the Lord's table and warns against participating in idol feasts. He instructs them to do all things to the glory of God and to avoid causing offense to Jews, Greeks, or the church of God.

## 1 Corinthians 11: Head Coverings and the Lord's Supper

Paul praises them for keeping certain traditions but addresses issues of head coverings in worship. He describes order in creation and urges proper conduct in prayer and prophecy.

He then rebukes their behavior at the Lord's Supper. Some eat and drink selfishly while others go hungry. He recounts the words of the Lord Jesus on the night He is betrayed and warns that whoever eats and drinks unworthily is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 12: Spiritual Gifts and the Body

Paul explains spiritual gifts and says there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit. He lists gifts such as wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, and tongues.

He compares the church to a body with many members. Each part is necessary, and no one can say to another that they are not needed. God sets the members in the body as He pleases.

## 1 Corinthians 13: The Way of Charity

Paul declares that speaking in tongues, prophecy, knowledge, and even sacrificial acts mean nothing without charity. He describes charity as patient, kind, not envious, not proud, not self-seeking.

He says charity never fails, while prophecies and tongues will cease. He contrasts partial knowledge with what is perfect and says faith, hope, and charity remain, but the greatest is charity.

## 1 Corinthians 14: Prophecy, Tongues, and Order

Paul urges them to pursue charity and desire spiritual gifts, especially prophecy. He contrasts prophecy, which edifies the church, with tongues that are not understood.

He instructs them to conduct gatherings in an orderly way, limiting tongues and requiring interpretation. He commands that all things be done decently and in order.

## 1 Corinthians 15: The Resurrection of the Dead

Paul reminds them of the gospel he preaches: Christ dies for sins according to the scriptures, is buried, and rises again the third day. He lists appearances to Cephas, the twelve, above five hundred brethren, James, and finally to himself.

He argues for the resurrection of the dead, saying that if there is no resurrection, faith is vain. He declares that Christ is risen and that death comes through Adam, while life comes through Christ. He describes the transformation of the body and declares that death is swallowed up in victory.

## 1 Corinthians 16: Collection, Travel Plans, and Closing

Paul gives instructions about a collection for the saints, setting aside offerings on the first day of the week. He speaks of his travel plans and mentions Timothy and Apollos.

He urges them to watch, stand firm in the faith, and do everything with charity. He greets them from Aquila and Priscilla and others, and closes with a blessing of grace in Christ Jesus.
