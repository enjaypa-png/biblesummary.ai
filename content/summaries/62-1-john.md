# 1 John

## 1–2: Walking in the light

The author begins by testifying to what he has seen, heard, and touched—the Word of life, which is the eternal life that was with the Father and was manifested to them. This testimony is shared so that the readers may have fellowship with the apostles, and through them, with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. The core message is that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. If people claim to have fellowship with Him while walking in darkness, they are lying. However, if they walk in the light, they have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses them from all sin. The author asserts that if people claim to be without sin, they deceive themselves, but if they confess their sins, God is faithful and just to forgive them and cleanse them from all unrighteousness.

He writes these things so that they will not sin, but if anyone does sin, they have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world. The assurance of knowing God comes from keeping His commandments. Whoever claims to know Him but does not keep His commandments is a liar. The author emphasizes the commandment to love one another, which is both an old commandment they have had from the beginning and a new one, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is now shining. Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in darkness. The author warns against loving the world or the things in the world, because all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father but from the world, which is passing away. He also warns that it is the last hour and that many antichrists have come, who deny that Jesus is the Christ.

## 3–4: Love and discernment

The author marvels at the love the Father has bestowed upon them, that they should be called the children of God. As children of God, they are called to purify themselves, just as He is pure. He who sins is of the devil, but the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. Those born of God do not continue in sin. The distinction between the children of God and the children of the devil is clear: those who do not practice righteousness or love their brother are not of God. The message from the beginning is to love one another, unlike Cain who murdered his brother. Love for the brethren is a sign of having passed from death to life. This love is not just in word or tongue, but in deed and in truth.

He encourages the believers that if their hearts do not condemn them, they have confidence before God and receive what they ask because they keep His commandments. The primary commandment is to believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and to love one another. The author warns them not to believe every spirit, but to test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. The test is this: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not is the spirit of the antichrist. The chapter culminates in the profound statement that "God is love." He who does not love does not know God. God's love was manifested by sending His only Son into the world so that they might live through Him. Since God so loved them, they also ought to love one another. If they love one another, God abides in them, and His love is perfected in them. There is no fear in love, because perfect love casts out fear.

## 5: Faith in the Son of God

Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of Him. Love for God is shown by keeping His commandments, which are not burdensome. Whatever is born of God overcomes the world, and the victory that has overcome the world is their faith. The one who overcomes the world is the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. The testimony of God is greater than the testimony of man, and God has testified concerning His Son. This testimony is that God has given them eternal life, and this life is in His Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.

The author writes these things to those who believe in the name of the Son of God so that they may know that they have eternal life. This knowledge gives them confidence in prayer, that if they ask anything according to His will, He hears them. He addresses the issue of seeing a brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, for which they should pray. He notes there is a sin that leads to death, for which he does not say they should pray. The epistle concludes with three certainties: we know that whoever is born of God does not sin, we know that we are of God and the whole world lies in wickedness, and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding to know Him who is true. The final exhortation is a simple, direct command: "Little children, keep yourselves from idols."
