## Isaiah 41: Fear Not, I Am With You

The LORD calls the nations to keep silence before him and to renew their strength. He asks who raises up the righteous man from the east and gives nations before him, making him rule over kings. He says he gives them as dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow, and he declares he is the first and with the last.

The isles see and fear, and the ends of the earth draw near. Craftsmen encourage one another and strengthen idols with nails so they do not move. The LORD then speaks directly to Israel, calling him his servant, the seed of Abraham his friend. He tells Israel not to fear, for he is with him, and says he strengthens, helps, and upholds him with the right hand of his righteousness. He promises those who contend with Israel are as nothing, makes Israel a new sharp threshing instrument that threshes mountains, and answers the poor and needy by making rivers in high places and fountains in valleys.

## Isaiah 42: Behold My Servant

The LORD presents his servant, whom he upholds and in whom his soul delights. He says he puts his spirit upon him and that he brings forth judgment to the Gentiles, not crying or lifting up his voice in the streets, and not breaking a bruised reed. The LORD says he calls him in righteousness, holds his hand, keeps him, and gives him for a covenant of the people and a light of the Gentiles.

The LORD declares his glory he does not give to another nor his praise to graven images. He speaks of new things before they spring forth and calls for a new song from the ends of the earth. The chapter describes the LORD going forth as a mighty man and crying out against his enemies. It describes a people robbed and spoiled, snared in holes, yet not saying, “Restore,” and it says they do not lay it to heart. The LORD pours upon them fury of his anger and the strength of battle, yet they do not know or consider.

## Isaiah 43: You Are My Witnesses

The LORD speaks to Jacob and Israel, saying he creates and forms them and redeems them. He tells them not to fear, for he calls them by name and they are his. He says when they pass through waters and fire, he is with them and they are not overwhelmed, and he declares he gives Egypt for their ransom and that they are precious in his sight.

The LORD calls Israel his witnesses and his servant whom he chooses, that they may know and believe him. He says before him no god is formed, neither after him, and besides him there is no savior. He promises a new thing, making a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert for his chosen people, declares he blots out transgressions for his own sake and remembers sins no more, yet recounts Jacob’s failures and says he gives Jacob to the curse and Israel to reproaches.

## Isaiah 44: Besides Me There Is No God

The LORD speaks again to Jacob and Israel, telling them not to fear. He says he pours water upon the thirsty and floods upon the dry ground, and pours his spirit upon their seed. He declares, “I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God,” and challenges any to declare and set in order what he does.

The chapter describes the folly of idol-making in detail. It speaks of a craftsman forming a god from part of a tree, warming himself with one part and baking bread, and making a graven image from the rest. It says he feeds on ashes and a deceived heart turns him aside. The LORD calls Jacob to remember these things and says he blots out transgressions like a thick cloud. He names Cyrus as his shepherd who performs his pleasure and says of Jerusalem, “Thou shalt be built,” and of the temple, “Thy foundation shall be laid.”

## Isaiah 45: Cyrus My Anointed

The LORD speaks to Cyrus, calling him his anointed and saying he holds his right hand to subdue nations. He says he goes before him and makes crooked places straight, breaking gates of brass and cutting bars of iron. He declares he does this for Jacob his servant’s sake and calls Cyrus by name, though Cyrus does not know him.

The LORD declares there is none else, forming light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil. He calls for the heavens to drop down righteousness and for the earth to open. He rebukes those who strive with their Maker and questions clay speaking against the potter. He declares that to him every knee bows and every tongue swears, and that in the LORD all the seed of Israel is justified and glories.

## Isaiah 46: Remember Me, Not Idols

The narrative describes Bel bowing down and Nebo stooping, their idols carried upon beasts and cattle as burdens. It says they stoop and bow together and cannot deliver the burden but go into captivity. The LORD contrasts himself with idols and says he carries his people from the womb and even to old age, declaring he is God and there is none like him.

He says he declares the end from the beginning and calls a ravenous bird from the east to execute his counsel. He speaks to the stouthearted far from righteousness and says he brings near his righteousness and places salvation in Zion. The chapter emphasizes the LORD’s purpose standing and his pleasure being done, and he calls Israel to remember these things and show themselves men.

## Isaiah 47: Judgment on Babylon

The LORD addresses Babylon as the virgin daughter and commands her to come down and sit in the dust. He says there is no throne and she is no more called tender and delicate. He declares her nakedness uncovered and vengeance taken, with no one meeting him as a man. He reminds her of her sorceries and enchantments in which she labors from youth.

The chapter describes Babylon trusting in wickedness and saying none sees her. It says her wisdom and knowledge pervert her and she says in her heart, “I am, and none else beside me.” It declares evil comes upon her and she does not know its source, and mischief falls on her suddenly. The LORD says her astrologers, stargazers, and monthly prognosticators do not save her, and she becomes as stubble before fire.

## Isaiah 48: For My Name’s Sake

The LORD addresses the house of Jacob, called by the name of Israel, but not in truth nor in righteousness. He says he declares former things from the beginning and they come to pass. He says he does new things now, before they spring forth, so they cannot say they know them, and he rebukes them for being obstinate, with neck like iron sinew and brow like brass.

The LORD says for his name’s sake he defers his anger and refines them in the furnace of affliction. He declares, “I am the first, I also am the last,” and says his hand lays the foundation of the earth. He calls them to hear and says he has not spoken in secret. The chapter ends with the LORD saying there is no peace, says the LORD, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 49: A Light to the Gentiles

The servant addresses the isles and people afar off, saying the LORD calls him from the womb and makes his mouth like a sharp sword. He says he labors in vain, yet his judgment is with the LORD. The LORD says he gives him for a light to the Gentiles, that he may be his salvation to the end of the earth.

The LORD speaks to Zion, who says the LORD has forsaken her. The LORD responds by asking if a woman can forget her nursing child, and says he does not forget Zion, engraving her on the palms of his hands. He describes kings and queens serving and says he contends with those who contend with Zion and saves her children.

## Isaiah 50: The Obedient Servant

The LORD asks where is the bill of divorce with which he puts away Zion, or which creditor he sells them to. He says for their iniquities they sell themselves. He asks why no one answers when he calls and declares his power to dry up the sea and clothe the heavens with blackness. The servant speaks again, saying the Lord GOD gives him the tongue of the learned to speak a word in season.

He says he gives his back to the smiters and hides not his face from shame and spitting, yet the Lord GOD helps him so he is not confounded. He calls those who fear the LORD to trust in the name of the LORD and stay upon their God, and contrasts them with those who kindle a fire and compass themselves with sparks, who lie down in sorrow.

## Isaiah 51: Comfort for Zion

The LORD calls those who follow after righteousness to look to Abraham their father and to Sarah who bore them. He says the LORD comforts Zion and makes her wilderness like Eden. He calls the people to hearken to him, for a law proceeds from him and his judgment rests for a light of the people, and he declares his salvation goes forth and his arms judge the people.

The LORD tells Zion to awake and put on strength. He reminds them of Rahab and the dragon cut in pieces and of the sea dried to make a way for the redeemed to pass over, and says the ransomed of the LORD return with singing. He rebukes fear of mortal man and says he is the LORD that divides the sea. He declares Jerusalem drinks from the cup of his fury but promises to take the cup from her hand and put it into the hand of those who afflict her.

## Isaiah 52: Good News of Salvation

The LORD tells Zion to awake and put on beautiful garments. He says she is redeemed without money and speaks of his people going down into Egypt and Assyria oppressing them, and of his name being blasphemed continually every day. He declares that his people know his name and that he speaks.

The chapter describes beautiful feet upon the mountains bringing good tidings. It calls for watchmen to lift up their voice and sing together as the LORD bares his holy arm before all nations, and all ends of the earth see the salvation of our God. It calls for departure from uncleanness and says the LORD goes before and behind them. It ends introducing the servant who deals prudently, exalted and extolled, yet marred more than any man.

## Isaiah 53: The Suffering Servant

The narrative voice asks who believes the report and to whom the arm of the LORD is revealed. It describes the servant growing up as a tender plant and a root out of dry ground, with no form nor comeliness, despised and rejected, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, bearing griefs and carrying sorrows.

The chapter says he is wounded for transgressions and bruised for iniquities, and the chastisement of peace is upon him, and the LORD lays on him the iniquity of all. It describes him oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening his mouth, and cut off from the land of the living. It says he makes his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death, yet he sees his seed and prolongs his days, and the pleasure of the LORD prospers in his hand.

## Isaiah 54: No Weapon Formed Against You

The LORD tells the barren to sing and break forth into singing, to enlarge the place of her tent and stretch forth her curtains. He declares her seed inherits the Gentiles and makes desolate cities inhabited, saying her Maker is her husband and the LORD of hosts is his name.

The LORD compares his anger to the waters of Noah and says he swears he is not wroth with her nor rebukes her. He says mountains depart and hills be removed, but his kindness does not depart. He describes building her with stones and sapphires and carbuncles, declares all her children are taught of the LORD, and promises that no weapon formed against her prospers and every tongue that rises in judgment is condemned.

## Isaiah 55: Come to the Waters

The LORD calls everyone who thirsts to come to the waters and buy without money and without price. He asks why they spend money for that which is not bread and calls them to hear and eat what is good. He says he makes an everlasting covenant with them, the sure mercies of David, and declares he calls a nation they do not know.

The LORD calls them to seek him while he may be found and to forsake wicked ways, saying his thoughts are not their thoughts and his ways higher than theirs. He compares his word to rain and snow that water the earth and do not return void. He says they go out with joy and are led forth with peace, and creation responds with singing and clapping as thorns are replaced with fir trees and briers with myrtle.

## Isaiah 56: House of Prayer for All Peoples

The LORD calls for justice and righteousness, for his salvation is near. He blesses the man who keeps the sabbath and refrains from evil. He addresses the sons of the stranger who join themselves to the LORD and the eunuchs who keep his covenant, promising them a name better than sons and daughters and an everlasting name.

The LORD says his house is a house of prayer for all people and that he gathers others besides those already gathered. The chapter then rebukes watchmen who are blind and ignorant, described as dumb dogs that cannot bark, greedy and looking to their own way and gain.

## Isaiah 57: No Peace for the Wicked

The narrative voice says the righteous perishes and no one lays it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none considering they are taken from evil to come, while the righteous enter into peace and rest in their beds. The LORD then addresses those drawing near, children of the sorceress and seed of the adulterer.

He describes idolatrous practices on high mountains and under green trees, setting their bed on every high mountain and enlarging it, making covenants with them. The LORD says he dwells in the high and holy place and with the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble. He declares peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, but there is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 58: True Fasting and Sabbath Delight

The LORD commands to cry aloud and show the people their transgression. It describes them seeking the LORD daily and delighting to know his ways, yet asking why their fasting is not seen. The LORD says in the day of their fast they find pleasure and exact all labors, and he declares the fast he chooses is to loose the bands of wickedness and let the oppressed go free.

The LORD promises that if they deal bread to the hungry and bring the poor to their house, then their light breaks forth as the morning. He says if they turn away their foot from the sabbath and call it a delight, he causes them to ride upon the high places of the earth. He describes guidance, satisfying the soul in drought, and making them like a watered garden, and says they rebuild old waste places and are called repairers of the breach.

## Isaiah 59: Sin, Judgment, and the Redeemer

The narrative voice declares the LORD’s hand is not shortened that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear, but iniquities separate between them and their God and sins hide his face. It describes hands defiled with blood and lips speaking lies, conceiving mischief and bringing forth iniquity.

The chapter says justice is far from them and truth falls in the street, and the LORD sees it and is displeased that there is no judgment. It describes him putting on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation on his head, repaying fury to his adversaries. It ends with the Redeemer coming to Zion and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, and with a covenant of his spirit and words not departing from their mouth or their seed’s mouth.

## Isaiah 60: Arise, Shine

The narrative voice calls Zion to arise and shine, for her light comes and the glory of the LORD rises upon her. It says darkness covers the earth, but the LORD arises upon her. It describes Gentiles coming to her light and kings to her brightness, and her sons coming from far and her daughters nursed at her side.

The chapter describes abundance of the sea converted to her and forces of the Gentiles coming, listing camels, dromedaries, and ships of Tarshish bringing sons and silver and gold. It says strangers build up her walls and kings minister to her, and declares her sun does not go down nor moon withdraw, for the LORD is her everlasting light and her people are all righteous.

## Isaiah 61: The Spirit of the Lord GOD Is Upon Me

The speaker says the Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon him, because the LORD anoints him to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the brokenhearted and proclaim liberty to captives and the opening of the prison. He declares the acceptable year of the LORD and the day of vengeance of our God, and describes comforting all who mourn in Zion.

He says they are called trees of righteousness and build old wastes, with strangers feeding their flocks and them being named priests of the LORD. He declares everlasting joy is theirs, and the LORD loves judgment and hates robbery. He says their seed is known among the Gentiles. The speaker rejoices in the LORD, clothed with garments of salvation and robe of righteousness.

## Isaiah 62: Zion’s Righteousness Shines

The speaker says for Zion’s sake he does not hold his peace and for Jerusalem’s sake he does not rest, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness. He says Gentiles see her righteousness and she is called by a new name that the LORD’s mouth names, described as a crown of glory in the LORD’s hand. She is no more termed Forsaken, nor her land Desolate, but called Hephzibah and Beulah.

The LORD sets watchmen on her walls who never hold their peace day nor night, telling them to give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. He swears by his right hand that her corn is no more given to enemies. It ends with a call to prepare the way of the people, remove stones, and lift up a standard for the people.

## Isaiah 63: The Day of Vengeance and Remembering Mercy

The narrative voice asks who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, glorious in apparel. The speaker answers that he speaks in righteousness, mighty to save. It describes garments stained red, and he says he treads the winepress alone, looking and finding none to help, so his own arm brings salvation and fury upholds him.

The chapter shifts to recalling the lovingkindnesses of the LORD and his praises, saying in all their affliction he is afflicted, and the angel of his presence saves them. It recounts rebellion and vexing his Holy Spirit, calls to mind Moses and the days of old, and ends with a plea for the LORD to look down from heaven and remember that Abraham is ignorant of them and Israel acknowledges them not, yet the LORD is their Father and Redeemer.

## Isaiah 64: We Are the Clay, You Are Our Potter

The speaker cries that the LORD would rend the heavens and come down, that mountains flow down at his presence. He says from of old men have not heard what God prepares for him that waits for him. He acknowledges meeting those who rejoice and work righteousness but confesses continued sin, saying all are as an unclean thing and righteousnesses as filthy rags.

He says no one calls upon the LORD’s name or stirs up to take hold of him, acknowledging the LORD hides his face because of iniquities. Yet he says, “We are the clay, and thou our potter,” and asks not to be very sore angry nor remember iniquity forever. He asks the LORD to consider that they are his people and describes Zion a wilderness and Jerusalem a desolation.

## Isaiah 65: New Heavens and a New Earth

The LORD says he is sought of those who did not ask for him and found by those who did not seek him, spreading out his hands all day to a rebellious people walking in a way not good. He describes their sacrifices in gardens and burning incense upon altars of brick, sitting among graves and eating swine’s flesh.

The LORD declares he repays into their bosom their iniquities and those of their fathers, yet brings forth a seed out of Jacob and his servants dwell there. He contrasts his servants who eat and drink and rejoice with those who are hungry and ashamed. He declares new heavens and a new earth where former things are not remembered, describes building houses and inhabiting them, and the wolf and lamb feeding together while the serpent eats dust.

## Isaiah 66: Heaven Is My Throne

The LORD says heaven is his throne and the earth his footstool, asking where the house built for him is. He says he looks to the one who is poor and of contrite spirit and trembles at his word. He describes sacrifices offered while choosing their own ways, and says he chooses their delusions. He says before Zion travails, she brings forth, and asks who hears such a thing.

He declares he extends peace to her like a river and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream, and says they see and rejoice and their bones flourish like an herb. He describes the LORD coming with fire and his chariots like a whirlwind to render anger with fury. It ends with a picture of all flesh coming to worship before him, and of those who transgress, whose worm does not die and whose fire is not quenched, and they are an abhorring to all flesh.

# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1: A Rebellious Nation

Isaiah speaks concerning Judah and Jerusalem during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. The LORD calls heaven and earth to hear His complaint against His people. He says He has raised and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Him. He compares Israel to an ox that knows its owner, yet His people do not know or consider Him. He describes the nation as sinful, weighed down with iniquity, corrupt, and turned away. Their land lies desolate, their cities burned, and strangers devour their land. Only a small remnant remains in Zion, preserved by the LORD of hosts.

The LORD questions why they continue in rebellion when their whole body is sick from head to foot. He rejects their sacrifices, offerings, incense, new moons, and appointed feasts, saying He is weary of them because their hands are full of blood. He calls them to wash themselves, put away evil, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow. He invites them to reason with Him, declaring that though their sins are scarlet, they can become white as snow if they are willing and obedient, but they will be devoured by the sword if they refuse. He condemns Jerusalem as a once faithful city now filled with injustice. He promises to turn His hand upon them, purge away their dross, restore judges as at the first, and redeem Zion with judgment, while rebels and sinners are consumed together.

## Isaiah 2: The Mountain of the LORD

Isaiah describes a vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem. In the last days, the mountain of the LORD’s house is established above the hills, and all nations flow to it. Many people say they will go up to the mountain of the LORD to learn His ways. The law goes forth from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He judges among the nations, rebukes many people, and they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation does not lift up sword against nation, and they learn war no more.

Isaiah calls the house of Jacob to walk in the light of the LORD. He describes how the land is filled with silver, gold, horses, chariots, and idols. The people bow to the work of their own hands. The LORD humbles the proud and brings down lofty looks. In the day of the LORD of hosts, He rises against everything proud and exalted. People hide in caves and rocks from the fear of the LORD and the glory of His majesty when He shakes the earth. Idols are cast to the moles and bats. Isaiah tells the people to cease trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils.

## Isaiah 3: Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah

The Lord, the LORD of hosts, removes from Jerusalem and Judah the stay and the staff, the whole supply of bread and water. He takes away mighty men, judges, prophets, elders, captains, counselors, skilled craftsmen, and eloquent speakers. He gives children to rule over them, and the people oppress one another. Disorder fills the city, and no one wants to take responsibility for leadership because the ruin is too great.

The LORD stands to judge His people and brings charges against the elders and princes for devouring the vineyard and crushing the poor. He declares that the daughters of Zion are haughty, walking with stretched-out necks and proud eyes. He says He will smite their heads and take away their ornaments, fine clothing, jewelry, and beauty. Instead of sweet smell there is stink, instead of a girdle a rent, instead of well-set hair baldness. Their men fall by the sword, and the city mourns. Seven women take hold of one man, asking only to be called by his name to remove their reproach.

## Isaiah 4: The Branch of the LORD

In that day, the branch of the LORD is beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth is excellent for those who escape of Israel. Those left in Zion and remaining in Jerusalem are called holy, everyone written among the living. The Lord washes away the filth of the daughters of Zion and purges the blood of Jerusalem by the spirit of judgment and burning.

The LORD creates over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night. Upon all the glory is a defense. There is a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.

## Isaiah 5: The Song of the Vineyard and Woes

The LORD speaks a song of His beloved concerning His vineyard. He plants it in a fruitful hill, fences it, gathers out stones, and builds a tower. He expects it to bring forth grapes, but it produces wild grapes. He asks the inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah to judge between Him and His vineyard. He declares He will remove its hedge, break down its wall, lay it waste, and command the clouds not to rain upon it. The vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and He looks for judgment but sees oppression, for righteousness but hears a cry.

Isaiah pronounces a series of woes. He condemns those who join house to house and field to field, those who rise early to follow strong drink, those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, those who call evil good and good evil, those wise in their own eyes, and those who justify the wicked for reward. Because they reject the law of the LORD, His anger burns, and He lifts up an ensign to distant nations. He calls them to come swiftly, and their roaring is like a lion. Darkness and sorrow fill the land as judgment approaches.

## Isaiah 6: Isaiah’s Vision and Call

In the year King Uzziah dies, Isaiah sees the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train fills the temple. Seraphim stand above Him, each with six wings. They cry one to another, saying, “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.” The posts of the door move, and the house fills with smoke. Isaiah cries out that he is undone, a man of unclean lips among a people of unclean lips, for his eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

One of the seraphim flies to him with a live coal from the altar and touches his mouth, declaring his iniquity taken away and sin purged. The Lord asks whom He shall send, and Isaiah responds that he is ready. The LORD sends him to tell the people they will hear but not understand and see but not perceive. Their hearts are fat, ears heavy, and eyes shut until the land is desolate and people are removed far away. Yet a tenth remains, like a stump after a tree is cut down, a holy seed in the land.

## Isaiah 7: Immanuel Sign and Assyrian Threat

In the days of Ahaz king of Judah, Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel go up against Jerusalem but do not prevail. The heart of Ahaz and his people shake with fear. The LORD tells Isaiah to meet Ahaz and tell him not to fear these smoking firebrands, for their plan does not stand. The LORD declares that within a set time Ephraim is broken so that it is no longer a people.

The LORD speaks to Ahaz, offering a sign, but Ahaz refuses. Isaiah declares that the Lord Himself gives a sign: a virgin conceives and bears a son called Immanuel. Before the child knows to refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings is forsaken. The LORD brings the king of Assyria upon Judah, shaving the land like a razor and leaving it desolate. People live on butter and honey in a land overgrown with briars and thorns.

## Isaiah 8: Maher-shalal-hash-baz and the Stumbling Stone

The LORD tells Isaiah to take a great roll and write concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. He takes faithful witnesses and goes in to the prophetess, who conceives and bears a son with that name. Before the child can cry “My father” or “My mother,” the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria are taken away by the king of Assyria. Because the people refuse the waters of Shiloah and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son, the LORD brings upon them the strong waters of the river, even the king of Assyria, overflowing Judah.

Isaiah warns the people not to fear what others fear but to sanctify the LORD of hosts. The LORD is for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling to both houses of Israel. Isaiah binds up the testimony among his disciples and waits upon the LORD. He declares that he and the children given to him are for signs in Israel. Those who seek familiar spirits instead of God walk in darkness, distressed and hungry, cursing their king and their God.

## Isaiah 9: A Child Will Be Born

The people who walk in darkness see a great light. Upon those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, light shines. The LORD multiplies the nation and increases joy. The yoke of their burden and the rod of their oppressor are broken. A child is born, a son is given, and the government is upon his shoulder. His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there is no end upon the throne of David.

The LORD sends a word into Jacob, and it falls upon Israel. The people respond with pride, saying they will rebuild stronger. Therefore the LORD sets up adversaries against them. His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. The people do not turn to Him who smites them. Leaders cause them to err, and the whole nation is devoured like fuel for the fire. Every man eats the flesh of his own arm, and they turn against one another, yet His anger remains.

## Isaiah 10: Assyria, the Rod and Then Judged

Isaiah pronounces woe upon those who decree unrighteous decrees and rob the needy of judgment. In the day of visitation, they have nowhere to flee. The LORD sends Assyria as the rod of His anger against a hypocritical nation. Assyria does not mean so in its heart but seeks to destroy many nations. The king of Assyria boasts that by his own strength and wisdom he removes boundaries and gathers riches.

The LORD of hosts declares that the axe does not boast against him who wields it. Therefore the Lord sends leanness among Assyria’s fat ones and kindles a burning under his glory. The Light of Israel becomes a fire and consumes them. A remnant of Israel returns to the mighty God. Though Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a remnant returns. The LORD promises to break the yoke from off their neck and destroy the oppressor.

## Isaiah 11: The Branch from Jesse

A rod comes forth from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch grows out of his roots. The Spirit of the LORD rests upon him, the spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of the LORD. He judges not after the sight of his eyes but with righteousness judges the poor and reproves with equity. He smites the earth with the rod of his mouth, and righteousness is the girdle of his loins.

The wolf dwells with the lamb, the leopard lies down with the kid, and a child leads them. The earth is full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. The root of Jesse stands as an ensign to the people, and nations seek him. The LORD sets His hand again to recover the remnant of His people from many lands. Ephraim does not envy Judah, and Judah does not vex Ephraim, as the LORD gathers them together.

## Isaiah 12: A Song of Salvation

Isaiah speaks a song of thanks addressed to the LORD. He says that though the LORD is angry, the LORD turns and comforts him. He calls the LORD his strength and his song, and says the LORD becomes his salvation. He says people draw water with joy out of the wells of salvation.

Isaiah calls others to give thanks to the LORD and to call on his name. He tells them to declare the LORD’s doings among the people and to make mention that his name is exalted. He urges them to sing to the LORD because the LORD does excellent things that are known in all the earth. He tells the inhabitant of Zion to cry out and shout, because the Holy One of Israel is great in the midst of her.

## Isaiah 13: Oracle Against Babylon

The narrative voice introduces a burden against Babylon that Isaiah the son of Amoz sees. The LORD speaks of raising a banner on a high mountain and calling a gathered army to come through the gates of the nobles. The LORD calls them his sanctified ones and the mighty ones for his anger, even them that rejoice in his highness. The sound is described as a multitude in the mountains, like a great people, as the LORD of hosts musters the host of the battle.

The LORD declares “the day of the LORD” as near, bringing destruction from the Almighty. He says hearts melt, hands are feeble, and people are in pain as travailing women, with faces like flames. The LORD says he punishes the world for evil and the wicked for iniquity, and he makes the arrogancy of the proud cease. The chapter describes the heavens and the earth shaking, and Babylon becoming as when God overthrows Sodom and Gomorrah, with wild creatures inhabiting its ruins and its time not prolonged.

## Isaiah 14: Taunt Against the King of Babylon

The narrative voice says the LORD has mercy on Jacob and chooses Israel, setting them again in their own land, and strangers join and serve with them. It says Israel takes captives whose captors took them, and they rule over their oppressors. It says that in the day the LORD gives rest from sorrow and fear, a proverb is taken up against the king of Babylon.

In that proverb, the speaker describes the oppressor ceasing and the golden city stopping, and the whole earth being at rest and breaking forth into singing. The speaker describes the fallen ruler brought down to the grave, with worms spread under and covering him, and kings in Sheol speaking to him as one made weak like them. The LORD of hosts declares he breaks the Assyrian in his land and treads him underfoot on his mountains, and he says this is his purpose for the whole earth and his hand stretched out over all nations.

## Isaiah 15: Oracle Against Moab

The narrative voice announces a burden of Moab and describes sudden ruin: in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and Kir of Moab is laid waste. It says Moab goes up to Bajith and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. It says Moab howls over Nebo and over Medeba, and on all their heads is baldness and every beard is cut off. It describes sackcloth on the housetops and in the streets, with everyone howling and weeping.

The voice describes Moab’s cry reaching to towns like Heshbon and Elealeh, and even the armed soldiers crying out. It says “my heart cries out for Moab,” naming fugitives and places like Zoar and Horonaim, and describing continual weeping on the way of Luhith. It describes the waters of Nimrim desolate and the grass withering, leaving nothing green. It says they carry away their abundance and what they have laid up over the brook of the willows, and the cry goes around the borders of Moab.

## Isaiah 16: Counsel for Moab and Coming Throne

The speaker calls for sending the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion. The chapter describes the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon as wandering birds cast out of the nest. A voice gives counsel: make judgment, make the shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday, hide the outcasts, and do not betray the one that wanders. The speaker says let the outcasts dwell and be a covert from the face of the spoiler.

The narrative describes the extortioner ending and the spoiler ceasing, and then says in mercy the throne is established, and one sits upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment and hasting righteousness. The speaker says he hears of the pride of Moab, calling it very proud, with his haughtiness and wrath, and says the lies are not right. The chapter describes lamenting for Moab, weeping for the vine of Sibmah and the fields of Heshbon, and the speaker says he waters it with his tears. It ends with a set time: within three years, the glory of Moab is brought into contempt, and the remnant is very small and feeble.

## Isaiah 17: Oracle Against Damascus and Israel’s Remnant

The narrative voice introduces a burden of Damascus. It says Damascus is taken away from being a city and becomes a ruinous heap. It says the cities of Aroer are forsaken and become places for flocks to lie down with none making them afraid. It says the fortress ceases from Ephraim and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria is as the glory of the children of Israel, says the LORD of hosts.

The chapter says in that day the glory of Jacob is made thin and the fatness of his flesh grows lean. It compares what remains to gleaning after harvest, like a few olives left on the topmost bough. It says in that day a man looks to his Maker and his eyes have respect to the Holy One of Israel, and he does not look to the altars, the work of his hands. It describes troubles like the roaring of many waters and nations rushing like mighty waters, but the LORD rebukes them and they flee, and in the evening there is trouble and before morning it is not.

## Isaiah 18: A People Brought as a Present

The speaker addresses a land shadowing with wings that is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. It describes sending ambassadors by the sea in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, and a command goes out to swift messengers. The speaker calls all inhabitants of the world to see when a banner is lifted on the mountains and to hear when a trumpet is blown. The LORD speaks of looking to his dwelling place like a clear heat and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

The chapter describes a time before harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape ripens, and the branches are cut off and taken away. It says the fowls of the mountains and beasts of the earth are left to feed on them, with summering and wintering on the remains. It then says in that time a present is brought to the LORD of hosts from a people scattered and peeled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion. The movement shifts from global summons to the LORD’s measured action and then to an offering brought in.

## Isaiah 19: Oracle Against Egypt and Future Healing

The narrative voice declares a burden of Egypt and says the LORD rides upon a swift cloud and comes into Egypt. It says the idols of Egypt move at his presence and the heart of Egypt melts in the midst of it. The LORD says he sets Egyptians against Egyptians, and they fight each other, city against city and kingdom against kingdom. The chapter describes Egypt’s spirit failing, counsel swallowed up, princes becoming foolish, and the river drying so that reeds and flags wither.

The LORD speaks of confusion among Egypt’s leaders and of the people being scattered in their counsels. The chapter describes fear in the land of Judah when Egypt hears of it, and it speaks of a time when five cities in Egypt speak the language of Canaan and swear to the LORD of hosts, one called the city of destruction. It says there is an altar to the LORD in the midst of Egypt and a pillar at its border, and the LORD is known to Egypt, and they cry to the LORD because of oppressors. It ends with a declaration that Israel is the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land, as the LORD of hosts blesses them and names them.

## Isaiah 20: Sign Against Egypt and Ethiopia

The narrative voice sets the time: in the year that Tartan comes to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Assyria sends him, he fights against Ashdod and takes it. It says at that time the LORD speaks by Isaiah the son of Amoz. The LORD commands Isaiah to loose the sackcloth from his loins and put off his shoe from his foot. Isaiah obeys and walks naked and barefoot.

The LORD explains that as Isaiah walks naked and barefoot three years, it is a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia. The LORD says the king of Assyria leads away the Egyptians prisoners and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. The narrative voice then says the inhabitants of that coastland are afraid and ashamed because of Ethiopia their expectation and Egypt their glory. It ends with a spoken question from the people: how shall we escape?

## Isaiah 21: Babylon Is Fallen, and Other Oracles

The narrative voice introduces a burden of the desert of the sea, describing it coming like whirlwinds in the south from a terrible land. The speaker describes a grievous vision: the treacherous dealer deals treacherously and the spoiler spoils, and the command comes to Elam to go up and to Media to besiege. The speaker says his loins are filled with pain and he is bowed down at the hearing and dismayed at the seeing. He says the night of his pleasure turns into fear.

The chapter shifts to a watchman set upon a tower who reports what he sees. He sees chariots and horsemen, and then announces, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen,” and says all the graven images of her gods are broken to the ground. The speaker addresses those threshed and says he declares what he has heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel. It includes burdens of Dumah and Arabia, with voices asking “Watchman, what of the night?” and a reply that morning comes and also night, and with instructions about fugitives in the wilderness and the diminishing glory of Kedar within a year.

## Isaiah 22: The Valley of Vision

The narrative voice introduces the burden of the valley of vision and describes a city full of noise and joy. It says the rulers flee and are bound by archers, and the speaker says, “look away from me; I will weep bitterly.” It describes a day of trouble, treading down, and perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts, breaking down walls and crying to the mountains. It describes the people looking to armor and making a ditch between walls for water, but not looking to the Maker of it.

The LORD of hosts calls to weeping, mourning, baldness, and girding with sackcloth, but the people answer with eating and drinking, saying they will die tomorrow. The LORD speaks in Isaiah’s hearing that this iniquity is not purged from them till they die. The chapter then turns to individuals: the LORD sends Isaiah to Shebna, who is over the house, and rebukes him for hewing a sepulchre on high and seeking glory. The LORD declares he removes Shebna and calls Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, placing the key of the house of David on his shoulder, but it ends with a note that the nail fastened in a sure place is removed and the burden cut off.

## Isaiah 23: Oracle Against Tyre

The narrative voice declares a burden of Tyre and calls ships of Tarshish to howl, because Tyre is laid waste so there is no house and no entering in. It says the report comes from the land of Chittim and that the merchants of Zidon and the seed of Sihor once fill her, bringing trade by the sea. The speaker says be ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea speaks, saying it does not travail nor bring forth, nor nourish young men or bring up virgins. The chapter describes the report troubling Egypt when it is heard.

The voice tells the people to pass over to Tarshish and howl, and asks if this is the rejoicing city whose antiquity is of ancient days. It says the LORD of hosts purposes it, to stain the pride of all glory and bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth. It describes Tyre forgotten seventy years, and then, after seventy years, she returns to her hire and commits fornication with all kingdoms upon the face of the earth. It ends saying her merchandise and her hire are holiness to the LORD, not treasured nor laid up, but for those who dwell before the LORD to eat sufficiently and have durable clothing.

## Isaiah 24: Earth Laid Waste, Remnant Praises

The narrative voice describes the LORD making the earth empty, wasting it, turning it upside down, and scattering its inhabitants. It says it happens alike to people and priest, servant and master, maid and mistress, buyer and seller, lender and borrower. It says the earth mourns and fades away, and the haughty people languish. The reason given is that the earth is defiled under its inhabitants because they transgress laws, change ordinances, and break the everlasting covenant.

The chapter describes a curse devouring the earth and says few men are left. It says mirth ceases, the new wine mourns, and all joy darkens. It describes the city of confusion broken down and every house shut up, and there is crying for wine in the streets. It shifts to voices: a remnant lifts up their voice and sings for the majesty of the LORD from the west, and glory is given to the LORD God of Israel in the isles. The chapter ends with the LORD reigning in mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and the kings of the earth and the host of the high ones being punished.

## Isaiah 25: Feast on the Mountain and Death Swallowed Up

The speaker addresses the LORD and says, “O LORD, thou art my God,” and then praises him in modern paraphrase as faithful and true. He says the LORD makes a city a heap and a defenced city a ruin, and it is not built. He says a strong people glorify the LORD, and the city of the terrible nations fears. He describes the LORD as a strength to the poor, a refuge from the storm, and a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is like a storm against the wall.

The chapter describes the LORD of hosts making a feast in this mountain for all people, with fat things and well refined wine. It says the LORD destroys the covering cast over all people and swallows up death in victory, and the Lord GOD wipes away tears from off all faces and takes away the rebuke of his people. The speaker says it is said in that day, “This is our God; we have waited for him,” and they rejoice in his salvation. It also speaks of Moab being trodden down as straw is trodden down for the dunghill, and the LORD bringing down the pride of its strongholds.

## Isaiah 26: Perfect Peace and Hiding Until Indignation Passes

The chapter begins with a song in the land of Judah and speaks of a strong city with salvation appointed for walls and bulwarks. The speaker calls to open the gates so the righteous nation that keeps truth enters. He says the LORD keeps in perfect peace the one whose mind is stayed on him because he trusts in the LORD. He urges trust in the LORD for ever, saying in the LORD is everlasting strength.

The speaker says the LORD brings down those who dwell on high and lays the lofty city low, so the foot treads it down. He describes the way of the just as uprightness, and says they wait for the LORD’s judgments and desire his name. He speaks of trouble and says the wicked do not learn righteousness even when favor is shown, and he says the LORD ordains peace for them and works all their works in them. The chapter includes a plea and a declaration that the LORD’s dead live, and it ends with a call to enter chambers and hide until indignation is past, as the LORD comes out to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.

## Isaiah 27: The Vineyard Kept and the Great Gathering

The narrative voice says in that day the LORD, with his sore and great and strong sword, punishes leviathan the piercing serpent and leviathan the crooked serpent, and he slays the dragon in the sea. It then speaks of a vineyard, with the LORD as its keeper. The LORD says he waters it every moment and keeps it night and day so no one hurts it. The LORD says fury is not in him, but if briers and thorns come against him, he goes through them and burns them together.

The LORD speaks of making peace and says let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. The chapter says Jacob takes root, Israel blossoms and buds, and fills the face of the world with fruit. It speaks of measured punishment, saying the LORD stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind, and it describes altars made like chalkstones beaten asunder. It ends with a gathering: the great trumpet is blown, and those ready to perish in Assyria and the outcasts in Egypt come and worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 28: Woe to the Drunkards of Ephraim and the Sure Foundation

The narrative voice speaks a woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower. It describes the LORD having a mighty and strong one like a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, casting down with the hand. It says the crown of pride is trodden under feet, and the glorious beauty is like a first ripe fig that someone sees and swallows quickly. It then says in that day the LORD of hosts is for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty to the remnant, and for a spirit of judgment and strength.

The chapter describes priests and prophets also erring through strong drink and being out of the way. The speaker describes their tables full of vomit and filthiness, with no place clean, and then mocks their teaching as “precept upon precept” and “line upon line.” The LORD speaks of speaking to this people with stammering lips and another tongue, offering rest, but they do not hear. It warns that those who make a covenant with death and say they have an agreement with hell are exposed when the overflowing scourge passes, and it ends with the LORD laying in Zion a foundation stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, and with images of a farmer who plows and threshes with wisdom taught by the LORD of hosts.

## Isaiah 29: Woe to Ariel and Lip-Service Worship

The LORD speaks against Ariel, the city where David dwells, and says add year to year and let feasts come around, yet he will distress Ariel. He says there will be heaviness and sorrow, and it will be to him as Ariel. He says he camps against the city round about and lays siege with a mount. The chapter describes the city brought down to speak out of the dust, with its speech low out of the ground, and a multitude of enemies as small dust and chaff.

The narrative describes sudden visitation from the LORD of hosts with thunder, earthquake, great noise, storm, and flame of devouring fire. It compares the nations fighting against Ariel to a dream of a hungry man who wakes and is still empty, and a thirsty man who wakes and is still faint. The LORD says this people draw near with their mouth and honor him with lips, but remove their heart far away, and their fear toward him is taught by precept of men. He pronounces wisdom perishing from the wise and understanding hidden, and he rebukes those who seek deep to hide counsel from the LORD, ending with a promise of Jacob not being ashamed when he sees his children sanctify the Holy One of Jacob.

## Isaiah 30: Woe to Those Who Trust in Egypt

The LORD speaks a woe to rebellious children that take counsel but not of him, and cover with a covering but not of his spirit. He says they go down into Egypt without asking at his mouth, to strengthen themselves in Pharaoh’s strength and trust in Egypt’s shadow. He says Egypt’s help is vain and empty and calls it “Rahab that sits still.” The chapter includes a command to write it before them in a table as a witness, because they are a rebellious people who say to seers, “See not,” and to prophets, “Prophesy not unto us right things.”

The LORD says their iniquity is like a breach ready to fall, breaking suddenly, and it is broken like a potter’s vessel with no pity. He says in returning and rest they are saved, and in quietness and confidence is their strength, but they will not. The chapter says they flee on horses, and therefore they flee, yet the LORD waits to be gracious and is exalted that he may have mercy. It describes the LORD giving bread of adversity and water of affliction, yet guiding them, and it speaks of the LORD’s voice causing Assyria to be beaten down. It ends with Tophet ordained of old, prepared for the king, deep and large, with fire and much wood, and the breath of the LORD kindling it like a stream of brimstone.

## Isaiah 31: Don’t Trust in Horses—Trust in the LORD

The speaker pronounces a woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, trusting in horses, chariots, and horsemen. He says they do not look to the Holy One of Israel nor seek the LORD. He declares the LORD is wise and brings evil and does not call back his words, and he rises against the house of evildoers and the help of those who work iniquity. He states Egypt is man and not God, and their horses are flesh and not spirit, so when the LORD stretches out his hand, both helper and helped fall.

The LORD speaks of coming down to fight for mount Zion and the hill thereof. He compares the LORD to a lion roaring on his prey, not afraid of many shepherds shouting. He says the LORD of hosts defends Jerusalem, defending, delivering, passing over, and preserving. The speaker calls Israel to turn to the LORD from whom they deeply revolted, and says in that day every man casts away idols of silver and gold. He says Assyria falls by a sword not of a mighty man, and his young men are discomfited, and he ends with fear seizing their princes, says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion and furnace in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 32: A Righteous King and the Spirit Poured Out

The narrative voice declares a king reigns in righteousness, and princes rule in judgment. It describes a man as a hiding place from the wind, a covert from the tempest, rivers of water in a dry place, and the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. It says the eyes of those who see are not dim, and the ears of those who hear listen. It says the heart of the rash understands knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers speaks plainly.

The chapter describes the vile person no longer being called liberal, and the churl no longer called bountiful, because the vile person speaks villainy and practices hypocrisy. It warns careless women to rise up and hear, describing days and years of trouble and the field and vineyard failing. It then says the Spirit is poured upon them from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and judgment dwells there. It ends describing peace as the work of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever, and the people dwelling in a peaceable habitation, while hail falls on the forest and the city is low.

## Isaiah 33: The LORD Our Judge, Lawgiver, and King

The speaker announces woe to the spoiler who has not been spoiled, and to the treacherous dealer who has not been dealt treacherously. He says when the spoiler stops spoiling, he is spoiled, and when the treacherous dealer makes an end, treachery is done to him. The speaker cries to the LORD for grace and says the LORD is exalted and fills Zion with judgment and righteousness. It describes the sinners in Zion afraid and asks who can dwell with devouring fire and everlasting burnings.

The chapter answers by describing the one who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, despises the gain of oppressions, and stops his ears from hearing of blood. It says such a person dwells on high and his bread and water are sure, and his eyes see the king in his beauty and a land far off. It describes Zion as a quiet habitation, a tabernacle not taken down, and says the LORD is their judge, lawgiver, and king, and he saves them. It ends saying the inhabitant does not say “I am sick,” and the people that dwell there are forgiven their iniquity.

## Isaiah 34: Judgment on All Nations and Edom

The narrative voice calls all nations and people to hear, and the earth and all that comes from it. It says the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations and his fury upon all their armies, and he utterly destroys them. It describes the slain cast out, the stink rising, and mountains melting with blood. It says the host of heaven is dissolved and the heavens roll together as a scroll, and their host falls like a leaf from a vine and fig tree.

The chapter focuses on Edom and Idumea, saying the LORD’s sword is bathed in heaven and comes down upon them for judgment. It describes a sacrifice in Bozrah and great slaughter, with the land turning into burning pitch and smoke ascending forever. It describes thorns growing in palaces and creatures inhabiting the desolation, naming birds and beasts, and says none lack her mate because the LORD’s mouth commands it. It ends with an instruction to seek out of the book of the LORD and read, emphasizing that his spirit gathers them.

## Isaiah 35: The Highway of Holiness

The narrative voice says the wilderness and solitary place are glad, and the desert rejoices and blossoms like the rose. It says it blossoms abundantly and rejoices with joy and singing, and the glory of Lebanon is given to it, with the excellency of Carmel and Sharon. It says they see the glory of the LORD and the excellency of our God. The speaker calls for strengthening weak hands and confirming feeble knees, and telling the fearful heart to be strong and not fear.

The chapter describes the LORD coming with vengeance and recompense, and saving. It says the eyes of the blind are opened, the ears of the deaf unstopped, the lame leap, and the tongue of the dumb sings. It describes waters breaking out in the wilderness and streams in the desert, and the parched ground becoming a pool. It says a highway is there, called the way of holiness, and the unclean do not pass over it, and no lion is there. It ends with the ransomed of the LORD returning to Zion with songs and everlasting joy, and sorrow and sighing fleeing away.

## Isaiah 36: Rabshakeh’s Taunts

The narrative voice says in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria comes up against all the defenced cities of Judah and takes them. It says the king of Assyria sends Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem with a great army, and he stands by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller’s field. Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the recorder come out to him. Rabshakeh speaks for the Assyrian king and challenges Hezekiah’s trust, mocking reliance on Egypt and questioning confidence in the LORD.

Rabshakeh claims Hezekiah misleads the people by telling them the LORD delivers them, and he says the Assyrian king offers terms if they surrender. He warns them not to let Hezekiah persuade them, and he speaks loudly in the Jews’ language so the people on the wall hear. Eliakim and the others ask him to speak in Syrian and not in the Jews’ language, but Rabshakeh refuses and continues. He describes exile with promises of a land like their own, and he lists gods of nations that do not deliver them, asking how the LORD delivers Jerusalem. The people hold their peace as the king commands, and the officials return to Hezekiah with clothes torn and report Rabshakeh’s words.

## Isaiah 37: Hezekiah’s Prayer and Assyria Defeated

The narrative voice says when Hezekiah hears it, he rends his clothes, covers himself with sackcloth, and goes into the house of the LORD. He sends Eliakim, Shebna, and the elders of the priests in sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet, and they say this is a day of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy. Hezekiah asks Isaiah to lift up prayer for the remnant that is left, because Rabshakeh blasphemes the living God. Isaiah speaks for the LORD and tells them not to be afraid of the words they hear, and says the LORD puts a spirit in Sennacherib so he hears a rumor and returns and falls by the sword in his own land.

The narrative voice says Rabshakeh returns and finds the Assyrian king fighting against Libnah, and then hears that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia comes out to fight him. Sennacherib sends letters to Hezekiah threatening him, claiming no god of any nation delivers from Assyria. Hezekiah takes the letter to the house of the LORD, spreads it before the LORD, and prays, naming the LORD of hosts and asking deliverance so all kingdoms know the LORD alone is God. Isaiah sends word from the LORD, speaking directly against Sennacherib and describing what the LORD says about him, including that the LORD knows his sitting down and going out and coming in. The LORD declares a sign for Hezekiah, promises protection for Jerusalem, and the narrative says the angel of the LORD smites 185,000 in the Assyrian camp, so Sennacherib departs and later is killed by his sons while worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god.

## Isaiah 38: Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery

The narrative voice says in those days Hezekiah is sick unto death, and Isaiah the prophet comes to him with a message from the LORD: set your house in order, for you die and do not live. Hezekiah turns his face toward the wall and prays to the LORD, asking to remember how he walks before him in truth and with a perfect heart, and he weeps sore. Isaiah goes out into the middle court, and then the word of the LORD comes to him to return to Hezekiah. The LORD says he hears Hezekiah’s prayer, sees his tears, adds fifteen years to his life, and delivers him and the city from the king of Assyria, and defends the city.

The LORD gives Hezekiah a sign: the shadow returns ten degrees on the dial of Ahaz. The chapter includes a writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after he recovers, where he speaks in first person about his sickness and recovery. He describes saying in the cutting off of his days he goes to the gates of the grave, and he speaks of mourning like a dove and chattering like a crane and swallow. He says the LORD casts all his sins behind his back and that the living praise the LORD, and he vows to go softly all his years. The narrative voice ends with Isaiah commanding a lump of figs to be laid on the boil, and Hezekiah asking what is the sign he goes up to the house of the LORD.

## Isaiah 39: Hezekiah and the Babylonian Envoys

The narrative voice says at that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan king of Babylon, sends letters and a present to Hezekiah, because he hears Hezekiah is sick and recovered. Hezekiah is glad of them and shows the messengers the house of his precious things: silver, gold, spices, precious ointment, all the house of his armor, and all that is found in his treasures. It says there is nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah does not show them. Isaiah the prophet comes to king Hezekiah and asks what the men say and where they come from, and Hezekiah answers that they come from a far country, even Babylon.

Isaiah asks what they see in Hezekiah’s house, and Hezekiah says they see all that is in his house and that he shows them all. Isaiah then speaks a word from the LORD of hosts. He says days come when all that is in Hezekiah’s house and what his fathers lay up in store is carried to Babylon, and nothing is left, says the LORD. He says of Hezekiah’s sons that come from him, some are taken away and become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Hezekiah answers Isaiah that the word of the LORD is good, and he says there is peace and truth in his days.

## Isaiah 40: Comfort My People

The LORD speaks words of comfort, saying “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,” and he addresses those who speak to Jerusalem. He says to speak comfortably to her and cry to her that her warfare is accomplished and her iniquity is pardoned, and that she receives of the LORD’s hand double for all her sins. A voice cries in the wilderness to prepare the way of the LORD and make straight a highway for our God, and it describes valleys exalted and mountains made low. Another voice says, “Cry,” and the answer speaks of all flesh as grass and the flower fading, but the word of our God standing for ever.

The speaker calls Zion that brings good tidings to get up into a high mountain and lift up her voice with strength, saying to the cities of Judah, “Behold your God!” It describes the Lord GOD coming with strong hand and ruling, and feeding his flock like a shepherd, gathering lambs with his arm and carrying them in his bosom. The chapter asks who measures waters in the hollow of his hand, spans the heavens, and weighs mountains, and it says nations are as a drop of a bucket and counted as small dust. It says he gives power to the faint, increases strength to those with no might, and that even youths faint and weary, but those who wait upon the LORD renew their strength, mount up with wings as eagles, run and not be weary, and walk and not faint.
