## Judges 1–2: Incomplete Conquest and the Cycle of Sin

After the death of Joshua, the tribes of Israel inquire of the Lord who should first go up to fight the remaining Canaanites. Judah is chosen and, with the help of the tribe of Simeon, achieves several victories, but fails to drive out the inhabitants of the coastal plain because they have iron chariots. The book then details the failures of the other tribes—Benjamin, Manasseh, Ephraim, Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali—to completely dispossess the Canaanites from their allotted territories. Instead of driving them out, the Israelites put them to forced labor, allowing pagan influences to remain in the land. An angel of the Lord appears at Bochim and rebukes the people for breaking their covenant with God by making treaties with the inhabitants of the land. The people weep and offer sacrifices, but the pattern of disobedience is set.

A new generation arises that does not know the Lord or the works He has done for Israel. This generation forsakes the God of their fathers, turning to worship the Baals and Ashtaroth of the surrounding peoples. This apostasy provokes the Lord's anger, and He hands them over to their enemies, who oppress them. When the Israelites cry out to the Lord in their misery, He raises up judges—deliverers who save them from their oppressors. However, as soon as a judge dies, the people relapse into even greater corruption, returning to their idolatrous ways. This establishes the book's central, recurring cycle: sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, followed by a period of rest, and then a return to sin.

## Judges 3: Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar

The first cycle of judgment begins as the Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord and worship idols. God's anger burns against them, and He sells them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, whom they serve for eight years. When the people cry out to the Lord, He raises up Othniel, the younger brother of Caleb, as their deliverer. The Spirit of the Lord comes upon him, and he leads Israel to victory, defeating the Mesopotamian king. The land has peace for forty years until Othniel's death.

After Othniel dies, the Israelites again do evil, and God strengthens Eglon, the king of Moab, against them. Eglon, allied with the Ammonites and Amalekites, defeats Israel and captures the city of palms, Jericho. The Israelites are subject to Moab for eighteen years. When they cry out for help, God raises up Ehud, a left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin. While delivering Israel's tribute, Ehud uses his left-handedness to his advantage, concealing a dagger on his right thigh. In a private audience with the obese King Eglon, he claims to have a secret message from God and stabs the king in the belly. Ehud escapes, rallies the Israelite forces, and leads them to a decisive victory over the Moabites, killing about 10,000 of their soldiers. The land enjoys peace for eighty years. After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath is mentioned, who strikes down 600 Philistines with an oxgoad, also saving Israel.

## Judges 4–5: Deborah and Barak

After Ehud's death, the Israelites once again fall into sin, and the Lord sells them into the hands of Jabin, a Canaanite king who reigns in Hazor. The commander of his army is Sisera, who lives in Harosheth Haggoyim. Sisera cruelly oppresses the Israelites for twenty years with his 900 iron chariots. During this time, Deborah, a prophetess, is leading Israel as a judge. She summons Barak from the tribe of Naphtali and delivers God's command for him to gather 10,000 men and go to Mount Tabor, promising to lure Sisera and his army into his hands. Barak agrees, but only if Deborah will go with him. She consents but tells him the honor for the victory will go to a woman.

As Barak's forces descend from Mount Tabor, the Lord throws Sisera's army into confusion, and they are completely routed. Sisera abandons his chariot and flees on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, as there is an alliance between King Jabin and Heber's clan. Jael welcomes Sisera into her tent, gives him milk to drink, and covers him with a blanket. While he is asleep from exhaustion, she takes a tent peg and a hammer and drives the peg through his temple, killing him. When Barak arrives in pursuit, Jael shows him the dead commander. Following this victory, the book presents the "Song of Deborah and Barak," a triumphant poem celebrating the Lord's victory. The song praises the tribes that answered the call to battle and rebukes those that did not. It vividly recounts the battle, the downfall of Sisera, and Jael's decisive action. The song concludes by imagining Sisera's mother anxiously waiting for his return, and the land has peace for forty years.

## Judges 6–8: Gideon

The Israelites again do evil, and for seven years God hands them over to the Midianites, who, along with the Amalekites and other eastern peoples, ravage the land, destroying crops and livestock and forcing the Israelites to hide in caves and strongholds. When the Israelites cry out to the Lord, He sends a prophet to rebuke them for their disobedience and idolatry. The angel of the Lord then appears to a young man named Gideon, who is secretly threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites. The angel calls him a "mighty warrior" and commissions him to save Israel. Gideon is full of doubt, pointing to his clan's weakness and his own low status, but the Lord assures him of His presence. As a sign, Gideon prepares an offering, and the angel of the Lord touches it with his staff, causing fire to consume it. That night, God instructs Gideon to tear down his father's altar to Baal and the accompanying Asherah pole and to build an altar to the Lord in its place. Gideon obeys, and the next day, the townspeople are furious, but Gideon's father, Joash, defends him, saying, "If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself." From then on, Gideon is called Jerub-Baal, meaning "let Baal contend with him."

As the Midianite army gathers, the Spirit of the Lord comes upon Gideon, and he summons men from several tribes to fight. Still seeking assurance, Gideon asks God for a sign with a fleece of wool: first, that the fleece be wet with dew while the ground is dry, and second, that the fleece be dry while the ground is wet. God grants both requests. The Lord then tells Gideon that his army of 32,000 is too large, for Israel might boast that their own strength has saved them. God instructs Gideon to dismiss anyone who is fearful, and 22,000 men leave. The remaining 10,000 are still too many. God tells Gideon to take them to the water and watch how they drink. He separates the 300 men who lap the water from their hands like a dog from the thousands who kneel to drink. God declares that He will save Israel with these 300 men. That night, Gideon and his servant spy on the Midianite camp and overhear a man telling a dream about a loaf of barley bread tumbling into the camp and striking a tent, which collapses. The man's friend interprets the dream as a sign that God has given the Midianites into Gideon's hand. Encouraged, Gideon divides his 300 men into three companies, giving each man a trumpet, an empty jar, and a torch to put inside the jar. At Gideon's signal, they surround the camp, blow their trumpets, smash their jars, and shout, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!" The Midianite army is thrown into confusion and panic, and they begin fighting among themselves. They flee, and Gideon's army, reinforced by men from other tribes, pursues them, capturing and executing two Midianite princes, Oreb and Zeeb. Gideon continues the pursuit of the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, and after a long chase, he captures and executes them as well. The Israelites ask Gideon to rule over them, but he refuses, declaring that the Lord will rule over them. He does, however, request their gold earrings from the plunder, from which he makes a golden ephod. This ephod becomes a snare, as all Israel prostitutes themselves by worshiping it. The land has peace for forty years during Gideon's lifetime.

## Judges 9: Abimelech's Treacherous Reign

After Gideon's death, one of his sons, Abimelech, whose mother was a concubine from Shechem, conspires to become king. He goes to his mother's relatives in Shechem and persuades them to support his bid for power, arguing that it is better to be ruled by one of Gideon's sons than by all seventy of them. With their financial support, Abimelech hires a band of reckless adventurers and goes to his father's house in Ophrah, where he murders sixty-nine of his seventy brothers on a single stone. Only the youngest son, Jotham, escapes by hiding. The citizens of Shechem then gather and make Abimelech their king. Jotham stands on Mount Gerizim and tells a parable of the trees anointing a king—the olive, fig, and vine all refuse the honor, but the worthless bramble accepts, only to bring destruction. He applies the parable to Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, predicting that fire will come from Abimelech and consume them, and fire from them will consume Abimelech. After three years, God sends an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, who act treacherously against him. A man named Gaal son of Ebed incites a rebellion, but Abimelech, with the help of Zebul, the governor of the city, crushes the revolt, destroys the city, and sows it with salt. He then burns a thousand people to death in the tower of Shechem. Abimelech proceeds to attack the town of Thebez, and as he approaches the base of a strong tower in the town, a woman drops an upper millstone on his head, crushing his skull. To avoid the disgrace of being killed by a woman, he orders his armor-bearer to kill him with a sword. Thus, God repays the wickedness of Abimelech and the men of Shechem.

## Judges 10: Tola and Jair

After the time of Abimelech, two minor judges are mentioned. The first is Tola, from the tribe of Issachar, who lives in the hill country of Ephraim. He judges Israel for twenty-three years. He is followed by Jair of Gilead, who judges Israel for twenty-two years. Jair is notable for having thirty sons who ride on thirty donkeys and control thirty towns in Gilead. After the death of Jair, the Israelites once again do evil in the eyes of the Lord, worshiping a wide array of foreign gods and forsaking the Lord. God's anger burns against them, and He sells them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites. The Ammonites, in particular, oppress the Israelites living in Gilead, east of the Jordan, for eighteen years. They also cross the Jordan to fight against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. In their distress, the Israelites cry out to the Lord, confessing their sin. The Lord rebukes them for their repeated apostasy and tells them to cry out to the gods they have chosen. The people, however, put away their foreign gods and serve the Lord, and He can no longer bear to see their misery.

## Judges 11–12: Jephthah and the Minor Judges

With the Ammonites oppressing Israel, the elders of Gilead turn in desperation to Jephthah, a mighty warrior whom they had previously driven out because he was the son of a prostitute. Jephthah agrees to lead them on the condition that he will become their head if he is victorious. After a failed attempt at diplomacy with the Ammonite king, the Spirit of the Lord comes upon Jephthah. As he prepares for battle, he makes a rash vow to God, promising to sacrifice as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to meet him upon his return. Jephthah leads the Gileadites to a decisive victory over the Ammonites. As he returns home in triumph, his daughter—his only child—comes out to greet him with dancing and music. Devastated, Jephthah feels bound by his vow. His daughter accepts her fate but asks for two months to mourn her virginity with her friends. After two months, she returns, and Jephthah does to her as he had vowed.

Following this, a conflict arises with the tribe of Ephraim, who are angry they were not called to fight the Ammonites. Jephthah and his men fight and defeat the Ephraimites. They guard the fords of the Jordan River and identify fleeing Ephraimites by making them say "Shibboleth." The Ephraimites' inability to pronounce the "sh" sound leads to the slaughter of 42,000 of their men. Jephthah judges Israel for six years. He is followed by a series of minor judges: Ibzan of Bethlehem, who judged for seven years; Elon the Zebulunite, who judged for ten years; and Abdon of Pirathon, who judged for eight years.

## Judges 13–16: Samson

The Israelites again do evil, and God delivers them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. An angel of the Lord appears to the barren wife of Manoah, a Danite, and announces that she will bear a son who will be a Nazirite from birth, set apart for God. This son, Samson, is to have his hair uncut and will begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines. As a young man, the Spirit of the Lord begins to stir in him, and he demonstrates incredible strength. He insists on marrying a Philistine woman from Timnah, which, unknown to his parents, is part of God's plan to provoke the Philistines. On his way to Timnah, he kills a lion with his bare hands. Later, he finds a swarm of bees and honey in the lion's carcass and poses a riddle about it to his thirty Philistine wedding companions. When they cannot solve it, they threaten his wife, who coaxes the answer from him. Enraged by their deception, Samson kills thirty Philistine men and gives their clothes to his companions. His wife is then given to his best man.

Samson's story is a series of personal vendettas against the Philistines, marked by incredible feats of strength and a weakness for treacherous women. He catches 300 foxes, ties their tails in pairs with torches, and sets them loose in the Philistines' grain fields. He slaughters many Philistines, and when the men of Judah try to hand him over to his enemies, he breaks his bonds and kills a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. He later falls in love with a woman named Delilah, who is bribed by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of his strength. After several false starts, Samson finally reveals that his strength lies in his uncut hair, the sign of his Nazirite vow. While he sleeps, Delilah has his hair shaved off. His strength leaves him, and the Philistines capture him, gouge out his eyes, and force him to grind grain in a prison in Gaza. During a great festival to their god Dagon, the Philistines bring the blind Samson to their temple to entertain the crowds. Samson, whose hair has begun to grow back, prays to the Lord for one last burst of strength. He places his hands on the two central pillars of the temple, pushes with all his might, and brings the temple crashing down, killing himself and thousands of Philistines. In his death, he kills more Philistines than he had in his entire life.

## Judges 17–18: Micah's Idol and the Migration of Dan

This section, along with the following chapters, marks a shift in the book, detailing the moral and spiritual anarchy that has gripped Israel, summarized by the refrain, "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit." A man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim steals 1,100 shekels of silver from his mother. When he confesses and returns it, she consecrates the silver to the Lord to make an idol, which is then placed in a shrine in Micah's house. Micah makes an ephod and other idols and installs one of his sons as his priest. Later, a young Levite from Bethlehem comes to his house, and Micah hires him to be his personal priest, believing that the Lord will now bless him.

Meanwhile, the tribe of Dan is seeking a place to settle, as they have not yet taken possession of their allotted inheritance. They send five spies to scout the land, who come to Micah's house and recognize the Levite's accent. They ask him to inquire of God if their journey will be successful, and he gives them a favorable answer. The spies continue north and find the peaceful and unsuspecting city of Laish. They return to their tribe and report on the promising location. The Danites then send out 600 armed men to conquer Laish. On their way, they stop at Micah's house, steal his idol, ephod, and other sacred objects, and persuade his Levite priest to join them, offering him the chance to be the priest of an entire tribe rather than just one household. Micah and his neighbors pursue them, but they are hopelessly outnumbered and forced to turn back. The Danites go on to capture and destroy Laish, rebuilding it and renaming it Dan. They set up Micah's idol and establish a priesthood that lasts for generations, a stark example of the religious corruption and tribal lawlessness of the period.

## Judges 19–21: The Levite's Concubine and the Civil War

The book of Judges concludes with a horrific narrative that plunges Israel into a brutal civil war. A Levite from Ephraim is traveling home with his concubine from her father's house in Bethlehem. They stop for the night in the Benjaminite city of Gibeah. While they are staying in the house of an old man, a group of wicked men from the city surround the house, demanding to have sex with the Levite. To save himself, the Levite shoves his concubine out the door. The men abuse her all night, and in the morning, she is found dead on the doorstep. The Levite places her body on his donkey, takes her home, and then cuts her body into twelve pieces, sending one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel, a gruesome call to action against the outrage committed in Gibeah.

Enraged, the other eleven tribes of Israel assemble an army of 400,000 men and demand that the tribe of Benjamin hand over the wicked men of Gibeah. The Benjaminites refuse, and a civil war ensues. The Israelites suffer heavy losses in the first two battles, but after seeking God's guidance, they set an ambush and finally defeat the Benjaminites, destroying their cities and killing almost the entire tribe. Only 600 Benjaminite men escape and hide in the wilderness. Afterward, the Israelites are filled with remorse, for they had sworn an oath not to give their daughters in marriage to any Benjaminite, which means one of the tribes of Israel is on the verge of extinction. To solve this problem, they first attack the city of Jabesh Gilead, which had not participated in the war, and kill everyone except for 400 virgin women, whom they give to the surviving Benjaminites. When this is not enough, they instruct the remaining Benjaminites to go to the annual festival at Shiloh and kidnap young women from among the dancers. This is done, and the tribe of Benjamin is saved from extinction. The book ends with its defining statement: "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit."
