## Nahum 1: The Lord's Vengeance and Good News for Judah

The burden of Nineveh comes through Nahum the Elkoshite. The Lord is jealous and takes vengeance; He is slow to anger but great in power and does not acquit the wicked. He walks in the whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet. He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, dries up rivers, and causes Bashan, Carmel, and Lebanon to wither. The mountains quake at Him, the hills melt, and the earth burns at His presence. No one can stand before His indignation.

The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble, and He knows those who trust in Him. With an overrunning flood He makes an end of Nineveh's place, and darkness pursues His enemies. He says He afflicts no more; though they are tangled like thorns and drunk like drunkards, they are devoured like stubble. One comes out of Nineveh who imagines evil against the Lord and counsels wickedness. The Lord declares that though they are many and strong, they are cut down. He breaks the yoke from Judah's neck and commands that the name of Nineveh be cut off, its graven image destroyed, and its grave prepared because it is vile. The one who brings good news appears on the mountains, announcing peace to Judah and the end of the wicked passing through her.

## Nahum 2: The Fall of Nineveh

The one who scatters advances against Nineveh. The people are told to guard the fortress, watch the road, strengthen their loins, and fortify their power. The Lord restores the excellence of Jacob as the excellence of Israel, though emptiers have emptied them and ruined their vine branches. The shields of mighty men are red, warriors are in scarlet, and chariots flash like torches as they rush through the streets. They jostle one another and run like lightning.

Nineveh's gates are opened, and the palace melts. Huzzab is led away captive with her maidens mourning like doves. Nineveh is like a pool of water whose people flee, and none look back. Silver and gold are taken without end. The city is empty, void, and waste; hearts melt and knees shake. The Lord asks where the dwelling of the lions is, where the lion tore prey for his cubs and filled his dens with spoil. The Lord of hosts declares He is against Nineveh, burns her chariots in smoke, devours her young lions with the sword, and cuts off her prey from the earth.

## Nahum 3: Woe to the Bloody City

Woe to the bloody city, full of lies and robbery. The sound of the whip and the rattling wheels fills the air as horses prance and chariots leap. Horsemen charge with flashing swords and glittering spears, and there is a multitude of slain bodies. Nineveh is described as a well-favored harlot who sells nations through her prostitution and families through her sorceries. The Lord of hosts declares He is against her and lifts up her skirts over her face, exposing her shame to the nations.

The Lord compares Nineveh to No, which sits among rivers and waters yet goes into captivity. Her children are dashed in pieces, and her nobles are bound in chains. Nineveh also becomes drunk and hides herself, seeking strength from the enemy. All her strongholds are like fig trees with ripe figs that fall when shaken. Her people are like women in the midst of her; the gates of her land are wide open to enemies, and fire devours her bars. She draws water for the siege and strengthens her fortresses, yet fire consumes her and the sword cuts her off. Her merchants are more than the stars, but they flee. Her shepherds slumber, her nobles rest, and her people are scattered upon the mountains with none to gather them. There is no healing of her wound; all who hear of her clap their hands over her fall, because her wickedness continually passes over them.
