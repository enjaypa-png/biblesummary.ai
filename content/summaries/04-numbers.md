# Numbers

## Numbers 1: First Census and Tribal Leaders

The LORD speaks to Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai and orders a count of the men of Israel who are twenty years old and able to go to war. A leader from each tribe stands with them: Elizur for Reuben, Shelumiel for Simeon, Nahshon for Judah, Nethaneel for Issachar, Eliab for Zebulun, Elishama for Ephraim, Gamaliel for Manasseh, Abidan for Benjamin, Ahiezer for Dan, Pagiel for Asher, and Ahira for Naphtali. The totals are recorded by tribe, and the combined number of fighting men is six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.

The tribe of Levi is not numbered with the others. The Levites are appointed over the tabernacle of testimony, its furniture, and everything that belongs to it. They are to carry it, set it up, take it down, and camp around it so wrath does not come on the congregation, while the other tribes camp by their own standards.

## Numbers 2: Camp Arrangement and Marching Order

The LORD assigns the layout of Israel's camp around the tabernacle, with each tribe grouped under its standard. On the east side, Judah camps with Issachar and Zebulun, led by Nahshon, with a stated count for each tribe and a total for that side. On the south side, Reuben camps with Simeon and Gad, led by Elizur, with counts and a total.

On the west side, Ephraim camps with Manasseh and Benjamin, led by Elishama, with counts and a total. On the north side, Dan camps with Asher and Naphtali, led by Ahiezer, with counts and a total. The Levites camp around the tabernacle in the center, and when Israel moves, the groups set out in the same order as they camp.

## Numbers 3: Levites Assigned and Firstborn Counted

The record identifies Moses and Aaron and Aaron's sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Nadab and Abihu die before the LORD when they offer "strange fire," and Eleazar and Ithamar serve as priests under Aaron. The LORD sets the tribe of Levi apart, placing them under Aaron to serve in the tabernacle work on behalf of the children of Israel.

Levi's sons are Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, and their families are listed. The LORD orders the numbering of Levite males from one month old and up, and their camps are placed around the tabernacle by clan, with Moses, Aaron, and the priests camping on the east. The duties are assigned: Gershon's families handle curtains and coverings; Kohath's families handle the most holy items under specific rules; Merari's families handle boards, bars, pillars, and sockets.

The LORD then orders a count of the firstborn males of Israel from one month old and up and sets up an exchange: the Levites instead of Israel's firstborn. When the count of Israel's firstborn exceeds the Levites, redemption money is collected for the extra firstborn, paid to Aaron and his sons.

## Numbers 4: Work Assignments for Tabernacle Transport

The LORD gives Moses and Aaron instructions for counting the Kohathites from thirty to fifty years old who do the work of carrying holy things. Aaron and his sons must cover the sanctuary items before Kohathites handle them: the ark, the table of shewbread, the candlestick, altars, and the instruments of ministry are wrapped and prepared for travel. Kohathites carry them but must not touch the holy things directly, and they must not go in to see the holy things uncovered.

The Gershonites are counted from thirty to fifty for carrying curtains, coverings, and hangings, under the oversight of Ithamar. The Merarites are counted from thirty to fifty for carrying frames, bars, pillars, sockets, and related equipment, also under Ithamar's oversight. Moses, Aaron, and the leaders record the totals for each clan according to their service.

## Numbers 5: Purity of the Camp, Restitution, and Jealousy Offering

The LORD orders the removal from the camp of anyone with leprosy, a running issue, or defilement from a dead body, so the camp remains clean where the LORD dwells among them. The LORD also commands that when a man or woman commits a trespass against another and becomes guilty, the person must confess, make full restitution, add an additional fifth, and give it to the one wronged; if there is no kinsman to receive it, the restitution goes to the LORD through the priest, along with the ram of atonement.

A law is given for cases of jealousy when a husband suspects his wife of adultery but has no witness. The priest brings the woman before the LORD with an offering of barley meal, prepares holy water with dust from the tabernacle floor, and sets the terms of the curse. The woman answers "Amen, amen," and the priest writes the curses and washes them into the water. The woman drinks the water, and the outcome is described as the LORD making the matter known; the husband is declared free from iniquity, and the woman bears her iniquity if she is guilty.

## Numbers 6: Nazirite Vow and the Priestly Blessing

The LORD gives rules for a Nazirite vow for a man or woman who separates themselves to the LORD. During the vow they must avoid wine and strong drink and anything from the vine, must not cut their hair, and must avoid contact with a dead body even for close family members. If someone dies suddenly near the Nazirite and defiles the head of separation, the Nazirite follows a set process of purification, offerings, and restarting the days of the vow.

When the days are fulfilled, the Nazirite brings offerings to the tabernacle: burnt offering, sin offering, peace offerings, bread, and drink offerings, and the hair is shaved and placed in the fire under the peace offering. The LORD then gives the blessing Aaron and his sons must speak over Israel, asking the LORD to bless and keep them, make His face shine on them, be gracious, lift up His countenance on them, and give them peace.

## Numbers 7: Offerings at the Tabernacle Dedication

When Moses finishes setting up the tabernacle, anointing it and its vessels, and anointing the altar and its vessels, the leaders of Israel bring offerings. They bring six covered wagons and twelve oxen, and the LORD instructs Moses to accept them for the service of the tabernacle and distribute them to the Levites according to their work.

The princes then bring offerings for dedicating the altar over twelve days, one leader per day, each bringing the same set of items: silver chargers and bowls with flour and oil, a golden spoon with incense, and animals for burnt, sin, and peace offerings. The chapter lists each day's leader by name and tribe and repeats the offering details. The total summary of the dedication gifts is then given. When Moses goes into the tabernacle to speak with the LORD, he hears the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat on the ark between the cherubims.

## Numbers 8: Lighting, Levites Cleansed and Set for Service

The LORD tells Aaron how the lamps are to be set so that the seven lamps give light in front of the candlestick. Moses does so according to the pattern shown in the mount. The LORD then commands the cleansing of the Levites: they are sprinkled with water of purifying, shave all their flesh, wash their clothes, and are brought before the congregation.

The Levites bring offerings, and the people of Israel lay their hands on them. Aaron offers the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the children of Israel, and the Levites are separated to do the service of the tabernacle. The LORD states that the Levites are taken in place of the firstborn of Israel, belonging to the LORD. The working ages are defined: service begins at twenty-five and ends at fifty, after which they assist but do not perform the heavy service.

## Numbers 9: Passover Kept; Second Passover; Cloud Guidance

In the first month of the second year after leaving Egypt, the LORD commands Israel to keep the Passover in the wilderness of Sinai at the appointed time. Moses speaks to the people, and they keep it on the fourteenth day at even, according to all the ordinances. Some men are defiled by a dead body and cannot keep it, so they bring the matter to Moses and Aaron. The LORD provides a rule: anyone who is unclean by reason of a dead body or is on a journey far off may keep the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and must follow the same rules. A foreigner who dwells among them may also keep it if he follows the ordinance.

The chapter describes the cloud covering the tabernacle and the appearance of fire by night. When the cloud stays, the camp stays; when it lifts, the camp journeys. Sometimes it remains for many days, sometimes a night, sometimes a few days, and Israel moves only at the LORD's command through Moses.

## Numbers 10: Silver Trumpets; Departure from Sinai

The LORD tells Moses to make two silver trumpets used for calling the assembly and signaling the camps to move. Specific blasts summon the princes or the whole congregation, and alarm blasts direct the camp's movement. The trumpets are also used in war and on feast days, so Israel is remembered before the LORD.

In the second year, second month, twentieth day, the cloud lifts from the tabernacle and Israel departs from the wilderness of Sinai, traveling by their standards. The marching order is given: Judah's camp sets out first, then Reuben's, with the tabernacle components carried by Gershon and Merari, then Ephraim's camp, then Dan's camp. Moses speaks to Hobab son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, urging him to come as a guide; Hobab hesitates, and Moses presses the invitation, promising good as the LORD does good to Israel. The ark goes before them to seek out a resting place, and Moses speaks set words when the ark sets forward and when it rests.

## Numbers 11: Complaints, Quail, and Elders Appointed

The people complain, and the LORD's anger burns; fire from the LORD consumes part of the camp. The people cry to Moses, Moses prays, and the fire is quenched, and the place is named Taberah. A mixed multitude among them begins to crave other food, and the children of Israel weep and demand meat, remembering foods from Egypt and despising the manna.

Moses brings his distress to the LORD, saying the burden is too heavy. The LORD tells Moses to gather seventy elders of Israel, and the LORD takes of the spirit on Moses and puts it on the elders; they prophesy, and then it stops. Two men, Eldad and Medad, prophesy in the camp; Joshua son of Nun urges Moses to stop them, but Moses refuses and wishes all the LORD's people were prophets. The LORD then sends quail in great quantity, and while the meat is still between their teeth, a plague strikes the people. The place is named Kibroth-hattaavah, and they journey to Hazeroth.

## Numbers 12: Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses; Miriam Struck

Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman he has married, and they challenge Moses' unique role. The LORD hears it, and the text states Moses is very meek, above all the men on the face of the earth. The LORD suddenly calls Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to the tabernacle, comes down in the pillar of cloud, and speaks.

The LORD says He speaks to prophets by visions and dreams but speaks to Moses mouth to mouth, plainly, and Moses beholds the similitude of the LORD. The LORD's anger burns, the cloud departs, and Miriam becomes leprous, white as snow. Aaron pleads with Moses not to lay the sin on them, and Moses cries to the LORD to heal her. The LORD orders that Miriam be shut out of the camp seven days; the people do not journey until she is brought in again, and afterward they move from Hazeroth to the wilderness of Paran.

## Numbers 13: Spies Sent into Canaan; Their Return Report

The LORD tells Moses to send men to search the land of Canaan, one man from each tribe, each a ruler among them. Moses sends them from the wilderness of Paran and lists the men by tribe, including Caleb son of Jephunneh for Judah and Oshea the son of Nun for Ephraim, whom Moses calls Joshua. Moses instructs them to see the land, the people, the cities, the soil, the trees, and to bring back fruit; it is the time of the first ripe grapes.

They go up and search the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob near Hamath and come to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak, are present. They cut a branch with a cluster of grapes so large it is carried on a staff between two, and they also bring pomegranates and figs. They return after forty days to Moses, Aaron, and the congregation at Kadesh in Paran, show the fruit, and say the land flows with milk and honey, but the people are strong and the cities are walled and very great; they mention the Anakims, Amalekites, Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites, and Canaanites. Caleb stills the people and urges going up at once, but others say they cannot because the people are stronger, and they spread an evil report, saying the land consumes its inhabitants and the men there are of great stature; they describe seeing giants and feeling like grasshoppers.

## Numbers 14: The People Rebel; Judgment and Failed Invasion

The congregation lifts up its voice and weeps; they speak of returning to Egypt and accuse Moses and Aaron. They talk of choosing a captain to lead them back. Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh tear their clothes and speak to the people, saying the land is very good and urging them not to rebel against the LORD or fear the people of the land. The congregation talks of stoning them, and the glory of the LORD appears in the tabernacle.

The LORD tells Moses He will strike the people and disinherit them, offering to make of Moses a greater nation. Moses appeals to the LORD's name among the nations and to His declared mercy and justice. The LORD says He pardons according to Moses' word, but the generation that sees His glory and still tempts Him will not see the land; Caleb is singled out as following fully, and the children will enter, but the adults will fall in the wilderness. The spies who bring the evil report die by plague, and the people are sentenced to wander forty years, one year for each day of searching the land. The next morning the people attempt to go up into the hill country despite Moses warning them the LORD is not with them; the Amalekites and Canaanites come down, defeat them, and chase them to Hormah.

## Numbers 15: Offerings, Sabbath Breaker, and Tassels

The LORD gives Moses laws for offerings to be used when Israel comes into the land, including grain offerings and drink offerings that accompany burnt offerings and sacrifices. The same rule applies for the congregation and for a stranger who dwells with them. The LORD commands an offering of the first of dough as a heave offering.

Instructions follow on sins committed through ignorance by the congregation or by an individual, with specified offerings. In contrast, a person who sins "presumptuously" is said to reproach the LORD and is to be cut off. A man is found gathering sticks on the Sabbath; he is held until the LORD's decision, and the LORD commands that he be stoned outside the camp, which the congregation carries out. The LORD commands that fringes with a ribbon of blue be put on the borders of garments so Israel remembers and does all the commandments.

## Numbers 16: Korah's Rebellion and Judgment

Korah son of Izhar, of the sons of Kohath, joins with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, with two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, men of renown, and they rise up against Moses and Aaron. They say Moses and Aaron take too much on themselves and claim the whole congregation is holy. Moses falls on his face and sets a test: Korah and his company are to take censers, put fire and incense in them before the LORD, and the LORD will show whom He chooses; Moses says the chosen one will be holy.

Moses speaks directly to Korah and the Levites, saying they already have the service of the tabernacle and asks why they seek the priesthood also. Moses sends for Dathan and Abiram, but they refuse to come and accuse Moses of bringing them out of a land of milk and honey only to kill them in the wilderness, and they claim Moses makes himself a prince. Moses becomes very angry and appeals to the LORD regarding their offerings.

Moses tells Korah and all his company to be present before the LORD with their censers, and Aaron also. Korah gathers the congregation against Moses and Aaron at the door of the tabernacle, and the glory of the LORD appears. The LORD speaks of consuming the congregation, and Moses and Aaron fall on their faces and plead that the LORD not be angry with all for one man's sin.

Moses orders the people to depart from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram come out and stand in their tent doors with their wives and children. Moses declares that if they die the common death of all men then the LORD has not sent him, but if the earth opens and swallows them, it will show they have provoked the LORD. The ground splits, the earth opens, and it swallows them and their households, and they go down alive into the pit; the earth closes, and Israel flees, fearing the same. The two hundred fifty men offering incense are then consumed by fire from the LORD.

Eleazar son of Aaron the priest is commanded to gather the censers from the burning, as they are hallowed, and to make broad plates for a covering of the altar as a memorial that no stranger who is not of Aaron's seed comes near to offer incense. The next day the congregation complains that Moses and Aaron have killed the people of the LORD. A plague begins, and Moses tells Aaron to take a censer with fire from the altar and incense and go quickly to make an atonement; Aaron stands between the dead and the living, and the plague is stopped. The number who die in the plague is fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who die in the matter of Korah.

## Numbers 17: Aaron's Rod Buds

The LORD tells Moses to take a rod from each tribe's prince, write each man's name on his rod, and write Aaron's name on Levi's rod, and place them before the testimony in the tabernacle. The LORD says the man He chooses will have his rod blossom, and it will end the murmurings. Moses places the rods, and the next day Aaron's rod for the house of Levi buds, blossoms, and yields almonds.

Moses brings the rods out, each man takes his rod, and the LORD tells Moses to bring Aaron's rod back before the testimony to keep as a token against rebels. The people fear they will die if they come near the tabernacle, expressing dread about approaching holy things.

## Numbers 18: Priests and Levites: Duties and Provisions

The LORD speaks to Aaron about responsibility for iniquity connected to the sanctuary and the priesthood. Aaron and his sons are to serve in the priest's office, and the Levites are joined to them to help, but Levites must not come near the vessels of the sanctuary or the altar, and outsiders must not come near.

The LORD lays out provisions for priests: the holy offerings, portions of sacrifices, firstfruits, and devoted things belong to them. The firstborn of man and unclean beasts are redeemed, while clean beasts' firstlings are offered, with parts given to the priests. The LORD says Aaron will have no inheritance in the land because the LORD is his portion. The Levites receive tithes from Israel as their inheritance, and the Levites in turn give a tithe of the tithe to the priests.

## Numbers 19: Water of Separation and Rules for Defilement

The LORD commands a statute involving a red heifer without blemish, which is given to Eleazar the priest and slain outside the camp. Its blood is sprinkled toward the tabernacle, and the heifer is burned with cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and the ashes are kept for making water of separation for the congregation. Those involved in the process become unclean until evening and must wash.

The chapter sets rules for being unclean from contact with a dead body, being in a tent where someone dies, or touching bones or a grave. The water mixed with ashes is used for purification on the third and seventh days; if a person refuses purification, that person is cut off. The text stresses that uncleanness spreads to what the unclean person touches.

## Numbers 20: Miriam Dies; Water from the Rock; Edom Refuses; Aaron Dies

The children of Israel come to the wilderness of Zin in the first month and stay in Kadesh; Miriam dies there and is buried. The congregation has no water and gathers against Moses and Aaron, accusing them and wishing they had died with those who perish before the LORD. Moses and Aaron fall on their faces at the tabernacle, and the glory of the LORD appears. The LORD tells Moses to take the rod, gather the assembly, and speak to the rock so it gives water.

Moses gathers the people and speaks harshly to them, then strikes the rock twice with the rod, and water comes out abundantly. The LORD tells Moses and Aaron they will not bring the congregation into the land because they do not sanctify Him in the eyes of Israel. This water place is called Meribah because Israel strives with the LORD. Moses sends messengers to the king of Edom requesting passage along the king's highway, promising not to touch fields or wells, but Edom refuses and comes out with many people and a strong hand, so Israel turns away.

The congregation journeys from Kadesh to mount Hor. The LORD tells Moses and Aaron that Aaron will not enter the land and must die on the mount because of what happens at the waters of Meribah. Moses takes Aaron and Eleazar his son up to mount Hor, strips Aaron of his garments, puts them on Eleazar, and Aaron dies there. Moses and Eleazar come down, and when the congregation sees Aaron is dead, they mourn him thirty days.

## Numbers 21: Defeat at Hormah, Fiery Serpents, and Victories East of Jordan

Arad the Canaanite king of the south fights Israel and takes some prisoners. Israel vows to the LORD that if He delivers the people into their hand, they will destroy the cities, and the LORD hears and delivers the Canaanites; Israel destroys them, and the place is called Hormah. They then travel by the way of the Red sea to go around Edom, and the people grow discouraged and speak against God and Moses, complaining about the way and the food and calling the manna light bread.

The LORD sends fiery serpents among the people, many are bitten and die, and the people come to Moses confessing and asking him to pray. The LORD tells Moses to make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole so those who look on it live; Moses makes a serpent of brass, and those bitten live when they look at it. Israel continues traveling through named places, reaches the region of the Amorites, and Moses sends messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites asking passage, but Sihon refuses and fights; Israel defeats him and takes his cities.

Israel then turns toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan comes out against them. The LORD tells Moses not to fear him, and Israel defeats Og and takes his land. The chapter also includes travel notes and a song about the well, along with references to earlier sayings about Heshbon and Sihon.

## Numbers 22: Balaam Summoned; The Donkey Speaks

The children of Israel camp in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sees what Israel does to the Amorites and fears because Israel is many. Balak sends messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor by the river, asking him to come curse Israel, offering reward. Balaam speaks to the LORD, and the LORD tells him not to go and not to curse Israel because they are blessed, so Balaam refuses.

Balak sends more honorable princes with greater promises, and Balaam again seeks the LORD. The LORD tells Balaam to go with the men but to do only what the LORD tells him. Balaam rises and goes, but God's anger is kindled, and the angel of the LORD stands in the way with a drawn sword. Balaam's donkey turns aside three times to avoid the angel, and Balaam strikes it; the LORD opens the donkey's mouth, and it speaks, asking why Balaam strikes it. The LORD opens Balaam's eyes, and he sees the angel, who says the donkey saves Balaam's life because Balaam's way is perverse before him. Balaam offers to turn back, but the angel tells him to go on and speak only what is commanded.

## Numbers 23: First and Second Attempts to Curse Israel

Balak brings Balaam to the high places of Baal. Balaam tells Balak to build seven altars and prepare seven oxen and seven rams. Balaam goes aside, the LORD meets him, and Balaam returns with a message. Balaam says he cannot curse whom God does not curse and describes Israel as a people dwelling alone and not counted among the nations; he speaks of Israel's numbers and expresses desire to die the death of the righteous, while Balak complains he is blessing instead of cursing.

Balak takes Balaam to another place, the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and again they build seven altars and offer sacrifices. The LORD puts a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam says God is not a man that He should lie, and that He has blessed and will not reverse it. Balaam speaks of God seeing no iniquity in Jacob and describes the shout of a king among them; he says there is no enchantment against Jacob and no divination against Israel that will succeed. Balak again protests and asks Balaam not to bless or curse, but Balaam insists he must speak what the LORD says.

## Numbers 24: Final Sayings of Balaam and Balak's Anger

Balak brings Balaam to the top of Peor overlooking the wilderness. Balaam does not seek enchantments as before but sets his face toward the wilderness, and the Spirit of God comes on him. Balaam sees Israel dwelling according to their tribes and describes their tents, gardens, trees, and water, and speaks of a king higher than Agag and a kingdom exalted. He repeats that God brings Israel out of Egypt with strength and that Israel will devour nations and break their bones, and he speaks blessing on those who bless Israel and cursing on those who curse them.

Balak's anger burns, and he strikes his hands together and tells Balaam to flee, saying he intended to promote him but the LORD has kept him back. Balaam reminds Balak he warned he could only speak what the LORD put in his mouth. Balaam then delivers further sayings about what Israel will do "in the latter days," naming those he speaks against: Amalek, the Kenites, Asshur, and Eber, and ends with words about ships from Chittim afflicting Asshur and Eber. Balaam rises and goes his way, and Balak also goes his way.

## Numbers 25: Sin at Peor and Phinehas Acts

Israel stays in Shittim, and the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. They are called to the sacrifices of their gods, the people eat and bow down, and Israel joins to Baal-peor. The LORD's anger is kindled, and the LORD tells Moses to take all the heads of the people and hang them before the LORD against the sun, so the fierce anger may be turned away.

Moses tells the judges of Israel to slay the men joined to Baal-peor. In the sight of Moses and the congregation, while they weep at the tabernacle door, Zimri son of Salu, a prince among the Simeonites, brings Cozbi daughter of Zur, a Midianite woman of a chief house, into his tent. Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, takes a javelin, goes after them, and pierces them both, and the plague is stayed. The plague kills twenty-four thousand. The LORD speaks to Moses, praising Phinehas for turning away wrath and giving him a covenant of peace and an everlasting priesthood, and the names of the man and woman are recorded.

## Numbers 26: Second Census After the Plague

The LORD tells Moses and Eleazar the priest to take a new count of the congregation from twenty years old and up, all able to go to war. Moses and Eleazar count them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, and the results are given by tribe and family line. The text notes key family events as it lists them, including Reuben's line and the earlier rebellion of Dathan and Abiram, and it mentions that Korah's sons do not die.

The totals for each tribe are recorded, with a combined total of six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty. The Levites are counted separately from one month old and up, listing Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, and naming families and totals, including that among Kohath's descendants are Amram and his children: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam, and Aaron's sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, with Nadab and Abihu noted as dying for offering strange fire. The LORD states that none of those numbered in the first census remain except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.

## Numbers 27: Zelophehad's Daughters and Joshua Chosen

The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah—come near before Moses, Eleazar, the princes, and the congregation at the tabernacle door. They explain their father dies in the wilderness but not in Korah's company, and he leaves no sons, and they ask for an inheritance among their father's brethren. Moses brings their cause before the LORD, and the LORD grants their request and sets a law of inheritance order: daughter if no son, then brothers, then father's brothers, then nearest kinsman.

The LORD tells Moses to go up to mount Abarim and see the land, and says Moses will be gathered to his people as Aaron is, because Moses rebels at the water of Meribah in Kadesh and does not sanctify the LORD before the people. Moses asks the LORD to set a man over the congregation so they are not like sheep without a shepherd. The LORD tells Moses to take Joshua son of Nun, a man with the spirit, lay his hand on him, set him before Eleazar and the congregation, and give him a charge. Joshua is to stand before Eleazar, who will inquire by the judgment of Urim, and at that word Israel will go out and come in. Moses does as commanded and commissions Joshua publicly.

## Numbers 28: Daily, Sabbath, Monthly, and Festival Offerings

The LORD commands Israel to offer the daily burnt offering, two lambs each day with grain and drink offerings, one in the morning and one at even. Additional offerings are specified for the Sabbath, including extra lambs and accompanying offerings. The new moon offerings are detailed, including bulls, a ram, lambs, and a kid of the goats for a sin offering, with grain and drink offerings.

Offerings for appointed feasts are then laid out: Passover and the seven days of unleavened bread with required daily offerings, and the day of firstfruits with its offerings. The chapter emphasizes doing these offerings beside the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.

## Numbers 29: Offerings for the Seventh Month Feasts

The offerings for the seventh month are given in detail: the first day with blowing of trumpets, the tenth day as a holy convocation, and the fifteenth day beginning the feast lasting seven days. For each day of the feast, specific numbers of bulls, rams, and lambs are listed, along with the required grain and drink offerings, and a goat for a sin offering each day.

The pattern of decreasing numbers of bulls across the feast days is stated day by day, and the offerings for the eighth day assembly are also specified. The text repeats that these are beside vows, freewill offerings, and the continual burnt offering, grain offering, and drink offerings.

## Numbers 30: Vows and Household Authority

Moses speaks to the heads of the tribes about vows. If a man vows a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to bind his soul, he must not break his word and must do what comes out of his mouth. If a woman in her father's house makes a vow, and her father hears and holds his peace, the vow stands; if he disallows it in the day he hears it, it does not stand, and the LORD forgives her.

If a married woman makes a vow and her husband hears it, his response determines whether it stands; if he holds his peace, it stands, but if he disallows it, it does not stand, and the LORD forgives her. Rules are also given for widows or divorced women, whose vows stand against themselves, and for situations where a husband nullifies a vow later and bears iniquity.

## Numbers 31: War Against Midian and Division of Spoil

The LORD tells Moses to avenge Israel of the Midianites, after which Moses will be gathered to his people. Moses orders a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed men, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest goes with the holy instruments and the trumpets. They war against Midian, kill the kings of Midian—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—and also kill Balaam son of Beor with the sword.

They take the women and little ones captive, take spoil, burn the cities and castles, and bring captives and spoil to Moses, Eleazar, and the congregation. Moses is angry that they keep the women alive, since these are the ones who, through Balaam's counsel, cause Israel to trespass at Peor. Moses orders the killing of every male among the little ones and every woman who has known man, but the young women are kept alive. The soldiers must stay outside the camp seven days and purify themselves and the captives, and purification rules for garments and metals are given.

The spoil is counted and divided: half goes to the warriors and half to the congregation. A tribute is taken for the LORD from the warriors' half and given to Eleazar, and a levy is taken from the congregation's half and given to the Levites. The officers report that not one man is missing, and they bring a gold offering of ornaments to make atonement for their souls; Moses and Eleazar take the gold into the tabernacle as a memorial.

## Numbers 32: Reuben and Gad Request Land; Manasseh Receives Also

The children of Reuben and the children of Gad have much cattle and see that Jazer and Gilead are a land for cattle. They come to Moses, Eleazar, and the princes and ask for that land as a possession and ask not to be brought over Jordan. Moses confronts them, warning they will discourage Israel like the earlier spies and bring more wrath.

They propose a plan: they will build sheepfolds and cities for their little ones but will go armed before Israel until Israel is settled in the land, and only then return. Moses sets conditions: if they go armed and help until the land is subdued, they may have the land east of Jordan; if not, they will have possession in Canaan. The children of Gad and Reuben accept the terms. The text adds that Moses gives a portion also to the half tribe of Manasseh, sons of Machir, with details of the towns built and renamed.

## Numbers 33: Journey Stages from Egypt to Moab

Moses records the journeys of the children of Israel by their stages as the LORD commands. The chapter lists the departures and encampments from Rameses out of Egypt through many named locations, recounting key transitions like leaving Sinai, moving through the wilderness, and arriving at the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

The record includes brief notes, such as Egypt burying their firstborn as Israel departs and the LORD executing judgments on Egypt's gods. The chapter functions as an official itinerary of Israel's travel route up to their current camp in Moab.

## Numbers 34: Borders of Canaan and Leaders for Division

The LORD tells Moses the borders of the land of Canaan that Israel will inherit. The southern border is described from the wilderness of Zin by Edom, with specific points named. The western border is the great sea. The northern border is described by a series of named locations, and the eastern border is described with reference points down to the Jordan and the Salt sea.

The LORD names leaders who will divide the land: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun, and one prince from each tribe. The princes are named, including Caleb son of Jephunneh for Judah, and the chapter lists each prince by tribe.

## Numbers 35: Levite Cities, Cities of Refuge, and Murder Laws

The LORD commands Israel to give the Levites cities to dwell in, along with suburbs around the cities for their cattle and goods, with measured space around them. A total of forty-eight cities are to be given to the Levites from the tribes' inheritances, with larger tribes giving more and smaller tribes giving fewer.

Among these cities, six are cities of refuge, where someone who kills another without intent may flee. The chapter distinguishes between murder and accidental killing by listing cases involving iron, stone, wood, hatred, lying in wait, and sudden pushing. The congregation judges between the slayer and the avenger of blood, and the manslayer must stay in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; leaving early allows the avenger to kill without guilt. The chapter forbids ransom for a murderer and stresses that blood defiles the land and must be addressed as commanded.

## Numbers 36: Marriage of Zelophehad's Daughters and Tribal Inheritance

The chief fathers of the family of Gilead, of the children of Machir, of the tribe of Manasseh, come before Moses and the princes with a concern. They point out that Zelophehad's daughters receive an inheritance, and if they marry into another tribe, the inheritance will transfer, reducing Manasseh's portion over time. Moses brings the word of the LORD: the daughters may marry whom they think best, but only within the family of their father's tribe, so inheritance does not move from tribe to tribe.

The rule is stated broadly: each tribe's inheritance is to remain with that tribe, and any daughter who possesses an inheritance must marry within her tribe's family line. Zelophehad's daughters obey and marry their father's brothers' sons. The book closes noting these commandments and judgments are given by the LORD through Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
