## 2 Corinthians 1: God of All Comfort and Paul's Sincerity

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, greet the church of God at Corinth and all the saints in Achaia. Paul blesses God as the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, saying He comforts them in their troubles so they can comfort others. He describes suffering in Asia where he feels pressed beyond strength and expects death, but he says this teaches him to rely on God who raises the dead. He explains that God delivers them and continues to deliver them, and he asks the believers to pray for them.

Paul speaks about his conduct toward the Corinthians, saying he acts with sincerity and godly honesty. He explains that he plans to visit them but does not act lightly or with double-minded intent. He says Jesus Christ, preached among them by Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus, is not uncertain but firm. He assures them that God establishes them in Christ and has sealed them. He states that he delays his visit to spare them and says he does not rule over their faith but works with them for their joy.

## 2 Corinthians 2: Forgiveness and the Fragrance of Christ

Paul decides not to come to them again in heaviness because he does not want to cause sorrow to those who bring him joy. He writes previously with many tears so they would understand his love. He refers to a man who causes grief and says the punishment already given by many is enough. He urges them to forgive and comfort the man so he is not overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. He asks them to confirm their love toward him.

Paul says he comes to Troas to preach Christ and finds a door opened by the Lord, but he has no rest in his spirit because he does not find Titus his brother there. He leaves for Macedonia. He thanks God who always leads them in triumph in Christ and spreads the knowledge of Him. He says they are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are saved and those who perish. He states that they do not corrupt the word of God but speak sincerely as from God.

## 2 Corinthians 3: Ministers of the New Testament

Paul asks if he needs letters of recommendation, then says the Corinthians themselves are his letter, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God. He says their sufficiency comes from God, who makes them ministers of the new testament, not of the letter but of the Spirit. He contrasts the ministry of death written on stones with the ministry of the Spirit, saying the latter has greater glory. He recalls how Moses places a veil over his face so the children of Israel cannot look at the fading glory.

He explains that the veil remains when the old testament is read, but it is removed in Christ. When a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. He declares that the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. He says they all, with unveiled face, behold the Lord's glory and are changed into the same image from glory to glory by the Spirit.

## 2 Corinthians 4: Treasure in Earthen Vessels

Paul says he does not lose heart because he receives mercy. He renounces hidden dishonesty and does not handle the word of God deceitfully. He states that if the gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those who are lost, whose minds the god of this world blinds so they do not see the light of the gospel of Christ. He says they preach not themselves but Christ Jesus the Lord, and themselves as servants for Jesus' sake.

He describes having this treasure in earthen vessels so the power belongs to God. He speaks of being troubled, perplexed, persecuted, and cast down, yet not destroyed. He says they carry in their body the dying of the Lord Jesus so His life also appears. He declares that though the outward man perishes, the inward man is renewed daily. He calls their light affliction temporary and says they look not at what is seen but at what is unseen and eternal.

## 2 Corinthians 5: Our Eternal Dwelling and Ministry of Reconciliation

Paul says that if their earthly house is dissolved, they have a building from God, eternal in the heavens. He speaks of groaning and desiring to be clothed with their heavenly dwelling so mortality is swallowed up by life. He states that God gives them the Spirit as a guarantee. He says they walk by faith, not by sight, and are willing rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord.

He explains that all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ to receive what is done in the body. Knowing the fear of the Lord, they persuade others. He says the love of Christ constrains them because if one dies for all, then all are dead. He declares that anyone in Christ is a new creature and that God reconciles the world to Himself through Jesus Christ. He says God makes Christ to be sin for them, though He knows no sin, so they might become the righteousness of God in Him.

## 2 Corinthians 6: The Ministry of Reconciliation and Unequal Yoking

Paul urges them not to receive the grace of God in vain and says now is the accepted time and day of salvation. He describes his ministry, enduring afflictions, stripes, imprisonments, labors, and watchings. He lists qualities such as purity, knowledge, longsuffering, kindness, the Holy Ghost, and unfeigned love. He speaks of being treated as deceivers yet true, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich.

He tells the Corinthians that his heart is open to them and asks them to open their hearts in return. He commands them not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers, asking what fellowship righteousness has with unrighteousness. He says believers are the temple of the living God and quotes God's promise to dwell among them. He calls them to come out and be separate, promising that God will receive them and be a Father to them.

## 2 Corinthians 7: Godly Sorrow and Titus's Joy

Paul urges them to cleanse themselves from filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. He asks them to receive him, saying he wrongs no man. He says he speaks not to condemn but because he has confidence in them. He rejoices in their comfort and in the joy Titus reports about them.

He explains that though his earlier letter causes sorrow, he does not regret it because it leads to repentance. He distinguishes godly sorrow, which works repentance to salvation, from worldly sorrow, which brings death. He praises their earnestness and clearing of themselves in the matter. He says he rejoices because Titus is refreshed by them and because their obedience brings him joy.

## 2 Corinthians 8: The Grace of Giving

Paul tells them about the grace of God given to the churches of Macedonia, who in deep poverty abound in generosity. He says they give willingly beyond their ability and first give themselves to the Lord. He urges the Corinthians to abound in this grace also. He reminds them that though Jesus Christ is rich, yet for their sakes He becomes poor.

He encourages them to complete their earlier desire to give, explaining that willingness is accepted according to what a person has. He speaks of equality so that others' abundance may supply their need. He sends Titus and two other brethren to ensure the gift is handled honestly, taking care to provide honorable things in the sight of the Lord and men.

## 2 Corinthians 9: Cheerful Giving

Paul continues speaking about the offering for the saints, saying he knows their readiness and boasts of them to the Macedonians. He urges them to prepare the gift in advance so it is ready as a matter of generosity and not grudging obligation. He states that whoever sows sparingly reaps sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully reaps bountifully.

He says each person should give as he purposes in his heart, not reluctantly or by compulsion, because God loves a cheerful giver. He assures them that God is able to make all grace abound so they have sufficiency and can abound in good works. He says the service not only supplies the saints' needs but also causes thanksgiving to God.

## 2 Corinthians 10: Paul's Authority and Spiritual Weapons

Paul appeals by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, asking them not to force him to be bold when present. He says though they walk in the flesh, they do not war after the flesh, for their weapons are mighty through God to pull down strongholds. He speaks of casting down imaginations and bringing every thought into captivity to Christ.

He responds to those who judge him by outward appearance, saying as he is in letters when absent, so he will be in deed when present. He refuses to boast beyond his measure but only within the sphere God assigns him. He says he does not boast in another man's labors but hopes their faith increases. He declares that the one who glories should glory in the Lord.

## 2 Corinthians 11: Paul's Jealousy and Sufferings

Paul asks them to bear with his folly as he speaks, saying he is jealous over them with godly jealousy because he espouses them to one husband, Christ. He fears that as the serpent deceives Eve, their minds may be corrupted. He warns against those who preach another Jesus or another gospel. He calls such men false apostles who transform themselves into apostles of Christ.

He recounts his labors and sufferings: stripes, imprisonments, shipwrecks, dangers from robbers and false brethren, weariness, hunger, cold, and daily concern for the churches. He mentions being let down in a basket through a window in Damascus to escape the governor under Aretas the king.

## 2 Corinthians 12: Visions, Thorn in the Flesh, and Concern

Paul speaks of visions and revelations of the Lord, describing a man in Christ caught up to the third heaven and hearing unspeakable words. He says he will not glory in himself except in weaknesses. He tells of a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan sent to buffet him. He asks the Lord three times to remove it, but the Lord answers that His grace is sufficient and His strength is made perfect in weakness.

He says he gladly glories in infirmities so Christ's power rests on him. He expresses concern that when he comes he may find strife, envy, and impurity among them. He fears he may mourn for those who do not repent of uncleanness and other sins.

## 2 Corinthians 13: Final Warnings and Benediction

Paul announces that this is the third time he is coming and says every word is established by two or three witnesses. He warns that if he comes again, he will not spare those who sin. He urges them to examine themselves to see whether they are in the faith. He prays that they do no evil and that they be perfect and of one mind.

He writes these things while absent so that when present he does not have to use sharpness according to the authority the Lord gives him to build up, not destroy. He closes by telling them to rejoice, be perfect, be of good comfort, and live in peace. He ends with a blessing, invoking the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost with them all.
