## Zephaniah 1: The Day of the LORD

The word of the LORD comes to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, during the reign of Josiah king of Judah. The LORD declares that He will completely consume all things from the land—man, beast, birds, and fish—and cut off the wicked. He stretches out His hand against Judah and Jerusalem and says He will remove the remnant of Baal, the idolatrous priests, and those who worship the host of heaven. He speaks against those who swear by the LORD while also swearing by Malcham, and against those who turn back from following Him.

The LORD announces that His day is near, a day of sacrifice and judgment. He says He will punish the princes, the king's children, and all who are clothed with strange apparel. He describes a day of trouble, distress, darkness, and desolation. Silver and gold will not deliver the people in that day, and the whole land will be devoured by the fire of His jealousy.

## Zephaniah 2: Judgment on Surrounding Nations

The people are urged to gather together and seek the LORD before the decree brings destruction. They are told to seek righteousness and meekness, in hope of being hidden in the day of the LORD's anger. Judgment is then pronounced on surrounding nations. Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Ekron are declared desolate, and the land of the Philistines is destined for ruin.

Moab and Ammon are condemned for reproaching and magnifying themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts. They will become like Sodom and Gomorrah, a perpetual desolation. Ethiopia is told it will fall by the sword, and Assyria, including Nineveh, will become a dry wilderness where flocks lie down among the ruins.

## Zephaniah 3: Jerusalem's Sin and the LORD's Restoration

Jerusalem is described as rebellious, polluted, and oppressive. She obeys no voice and does not trust in the LORD. Her princes are compared to roaring lions, her judges to evening wolves, her prophets are light and treacherous, and her priests defile the sanctuary. The LORD remains righteous in her midst and brings His judgments to light each morning, yet the unjust know no shame.

The LORD declares that He will gather nations to pour out His indignation, but afterward He promises to turn to the people a pure language so they may call upon His name and serve Him with one consent. He says He will remove the proud and leave an afflicted and poor people who trust in His name. The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity or speak lies. The LORD says He rejoices over His people with joy, rests in His love, and rejoices over them with singing. He promises to gather the sorrowful, undo their affliction, and make them a praise and a name in every land when He brings them back.
