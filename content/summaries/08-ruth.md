## Ruth 1: A Journey of Loyalty and Loss

The book of Ruth begins during the time of the judges, a period of social and religious turmoil in Israel. Due to a severe famine in Bethlehem, an Israelite man named Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, move to the neighboring country of Moab. While there, Elimelech dies, and the two sons marry Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. After about ten years, both Mahlon and Chilion also die, leaving Naomi a widow in a foreign land with her two Moabite daughters-in-law. Hearing that the famine in Judah has ended, Naomi decides to return to her homeland. She urges Orpah and Ruth to go back to their own families, where they might find new husbands. After much weeping, Orpah kisses Naomi goodbye, but Ruth clings to her, delivering a powerful declaration of loyalty: "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God."

Seeing Ruth's steadfast determination, Naomi allows her to accompany her. The two women arrive in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. Their arrival causes a stir in the small town, and the local women ask, "Is this Naomi?" Embittered by her tragic losses, Naomi tells them not to call her Naomi (which means "pleasant") but to call her Mara (which means "bitter"), "for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me." She feels she went away full but has returned empty, a sentiment that sets the stage for the story of redemption that is to follow.

## Ruth 2: Ruth Finds Favor in the Field of Boaz

To support herself and Naomi, Ruth asks for permission to go and glean in the fields, gathering the leftover grain after the harvesters, a practice provided for the poor in the Mosaic Law. By what appears to be chance, but is guided by divine providence, she ends up in a field belonging to Boaz, a wealthy and respected man who happens to be a relative of Naomi's late husband, Elimelech. Boaz arrives to oversee his harvest and immediately notices the foreign woman working in his field. He asks his foreman about her and is told she is the Moabitess who returned with Naomi.

Impressed by what he has already heard of Ruth's loyalty to her mother-in-law, Boaz approaches her with exceptional kindness. He tells her to glean only in his field, to stay close to his female workers for her protection, and to drink from the water his men have drawn. He invites her to share a meal with him and his workers and secretly instructs his men to pull out extra stalks of grain from the bundles and leave them for her to gather. That evening, Ruth returns to Naomi with a surprisingly large amount of barley. When Naomi learns that Ruth has been gleaning in the field of Boaz, she is filled with hope. She recognizes Boaz as one of their kinsman-redeemers—a relative who has the right and responsibility to redeem the family's property and, in this case, to marry Ruth to continue the family line.

## Ruth 3: A Bold Proposal at the Threshing Floor

Naomi, seeing a potential for a secure future for Ruth, devises a daring plan. She instructs Ruth to wash, anoint herself, and put on her best clothes, and then to go to the threshing floor where Boaz will be winnowing barley that night. Naomi tells Ruth to wait until Boaz has finished eating and drinking and has lain down to sleep, and then to go in, uncover his feet, and lie down. She assures Ruth that Boaz will then tell her what to do. Ruth agrees to follow her mother-in-law's instructions precisely.

In the middle of the night, Boaz is startled to find a woman lying at his feet. He asks who she is, and Ruth identifies herself. She then makes a bold request: "Spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman." This is a symbolic and culturally significant way of asking him to take her under his protection and marry her, fulfilling his role as a kinsman-redeemer. Boaz is deeply moved by her action, praising her for her loyalty and character, as she has not sought a younger, perhaps more desirable, man. He blesses her and agrees to do as she asks. However, he reveals that there is another kinsman who is more closely related than he is and who has the first right of redemption. Boaz promises to settle the matter with the other kinsman in the morning. Before she leaves, he fills her cloak with a generous amount of barley, and she returns to Naomi, who waits expectantly for the outcome.

## Ruth 4: Redemption and the Lineage of David

Early the next morning, Boaz goes to the town gate, the place where legal matters are settled, and waits for the other kinsman-redeemer to pass by. He gathers ten of the town elders as witnesses and presents the situation to the other kinsman. He explains that Naomi is selling a piece of land that belonged to their relative Elimelech, and he offers the kinsman the first right to redeem it. The kinsman initially agrees to buy the land. However, Boaz then adds the crucial condition: whoever redeems the land must also marry Ruth the Moabitess to maintain the name of the dead with his inheritance. Upon hearing this, the other kinsman declines, stating that it would endanger his own estate. He then publicly relinquishes his right of redemption to Boaz, formalizing the act by taking off his sandal and giving it to Boaz, as was the custom in Israel.

With the legal matter settled, Boaz announces to the elders and all the people that he has acquired Elimelech's property and has taken Ruth as his wife. The people and the elders bless the union, praying that the Lord will make Ruth like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. Boaz and Ruth marry, and she conceives and gives birth to a son, whom they name Obed. The women of the town rejoice with Naomi, celebrating that the Lord has not left her without a kinsman-redeemer and that she has a son to care for her in her old age. Naomi becomes the baby's nurse, and her bitterness is turned to joy. The book concludes with a genealogy that reveals the significance of this union: Obed becomes the father of Jesse, and Jesse becomes the father of David. Thus, Ruth, the faithful Moabitess, is woven into the lineage of Israel's greatest king, and ultimately, into the ancestry of the Messiah.
