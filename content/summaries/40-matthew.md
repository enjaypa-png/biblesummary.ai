# Matthew

## Matthew 1: The Generation and Birth of Jesus Christ

The book begins with the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. It records the generations from Abraham to David, from David until the carrying away into Babylon, and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ, each being fourteen generations. The genealogy concludes with Jacob begetting Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

The birth of Jesus Christ is on this wise: His mother Mary is espoused to Joseph, but before they come together, she is found with child of the Holy Ghost. Joseph, being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example, is minded to put her away privily. But while he thinks on these things, an angel of the Lord appears to him in a dream, saying, Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. The angel saith she shall bring forth a son, and Joseph shall call his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins. Joseph, being raised from sleep, does as the angel had bidden him and takes unto him his wife, but knows her not till she has brought forth her firstborn son.

## Matthew 2: The Wise Men and the Flight to Egypt

When Jesus is born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, there come wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king hears these things, he is troubled. He gathers the chief priests and scribes and demands of them where Christ should be born. They say unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea. Herod privily calls the wise men and sends them to Bethlehem to search for the young child, telling them to bring him word again, that he may come and worship him also. The star goes before them until it stands over where the young child is. They rejoice, and entering the house, they see the young child with Mary his mother, and fall down and worship him, presenting him with gifts. Being warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod, they depart into their own country another way.

After they depart, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying to take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. Joseph arises and departs into Egypt by night. When Herod sees that he is mocked of the wise men, he is exceeding wroth and sends forth and slays all the children in Bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under. But when Herod is dead, an angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream, telling him to return to the land of Israel. Hearing that Archelaus doth reign in Judaea, Joseph is afraid to go thither, but being warned of God in a dream, he turns aside into the parts of Galilee and dwells in a city called Nazareth.

## Matthew 3: The Preaching of John the Baptist

In those days comes John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. John's raiment is of camel's hair with a leathern girdle, and his meat is locusts and wild honey. Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan go out to him and are baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. When he sees many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he calls them a generation of vipers and warns them to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. He declares that he indeed baptizes with water, but one mightier than he cometh, who shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. John forbids him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? Jesus answering saith unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him. When Jesus is baptized, he goes up straightway out of the water, and lo, the heavens are opened unto him, and he sees the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him. And lo a voice from heaven says, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

## Matthew 4: The Temptation of Jesus and the Beginning of His Ministry

Jesus is led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he is afterward an hungred. The tempter tells him, if he be the Son of God, to command that stones be made bread. Jesus answers, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone. The devil then taketh him to the holy city, setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and tells him to cast himself down. Jesus saith unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels come and minister unto him.

When Jesus hears that John is cast into prison, he departs into Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, he dwells in Capernaum. From that time, Jesus begins to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Walking by the sea of Galilee, he sees two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea. He saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway leave their nets and follow him. Going on from thence, he sees other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, and he calls them. They immediately leave the ship and their father and follow him. Jesus goes about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness among the people.

## Matthew 5–7: Sermon on the Mount

Seeing the multitudes, Jesus goes up into a mountain, and when he is set, his disciples come unto him, and he opens his mouth and teaches them. He begins with the Beatitudes, blessing the poor in spirit, they that mourn, the meek, they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, and they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake. He tells his disciples they are the salt of the earth and the light of the world. He saith he is not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil. He teaches that anger against a brother is a sin, as is looking on a woman to lust after her, and commands his followers to love their enemies and be perfect, even as their Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Jesus teaches on alms, prayer, and fasting, instructing that these things be done in secret. He gives a pattern for prayer, which begins, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. He warns against laying up treasures upon earth and says no man can serve two masters, for ye cannot serve God and mammon. He tells them to take no thought for their life, but to seek ye first the kingdom of God. He continues, Judge not, that ye be not judged, and to ask, seek, and knock. He gives the rule that whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. He warns of false prophets, which come in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves, saying they shall be known by their fruits. He concludes by likening those who hear and do his sayings to a wise man which built his house upon a rock. When Jesus ends these sayings, the people are astonished at his doctrine, for he teaches them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

## Matthew 8: Healings and the Calming of the Sea

When Jesus is come down from the mountain, great multitudes follow him. A leper comes and worships him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. Jesus puts forth his hand, touches him, and saith, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy is cleansed. When Jesus enters into Capernaum, a centurion beseeches him to heal his servant. Jesus saith he will come and heal him, but the centurion answers, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. Jesus marvels, saying he has not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And his servant is healed in the selfsame hour. Jesus then comes into Peter's house and heals his wife's mother of a fever. When the even is come, he casts out many devils and heals all that are sick.

When Jesus sees great multitudes, he gives commandment to depart unto the other side. He enters into a ship with his disciples, and a great tempest arises, but he is asleep. The disciples awake him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. He saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he ariseth, and rebuketh the winds and the sea; and there is a great calm. When he is come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two possessed with devils meet him. The devils beseech him, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. He saith unto them, Go. They go into the herd of swine, which runs violently down a steep place into the sea and perishes. The whole city comes out and beseeches him that he would depart out of their coasts.

## Matthew 9: The Calling of Matthew and More Miracles

Jesus enters into a ship, passes over, and comes into his own city. They bring to him a man sick of the palsy. Jesus, seeing their faith, saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. Certain scribes say within themselves, This man blasphemeth. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, saith, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. The man arises, and the multitudes marvel. As Jesus passes forth, he sees a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and saith unto him, Follow me. And he arises, and follows him. As Jesus sits at meat in the house, many publicans and sinners come and sit down with him. The Pharisees ask his disciples why their Master eateth with publicans and sinners. Jesus, hearing that, saith unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

While he speaks, a certain ruler worships him, saying his daughter is even now dead, but if Jesus will come and lay his hand upon her, she shall live. As Jesus follows him, a woman with an issue of blood twelve years touches the hem of his garment. Jesus turns, sees her, and saith, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman is made whole from that hour. When Jesus comes into the ruler's house, he saith the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. They laugh him to scorn. He puts the people forth, takes her by the hand, and the maid ariseth. As Jesus departs thence, two blind men follow him. In the house, he touches their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you, and their eyes are opened. Then they bring to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. When the devil is cast out, the dumb speaketh. But the Pharisees say, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.

## Matthew 10: The Mission of the Twelve Apostles

Jesus calls unto him his twelve disciples and gives them power against unclean spirits and to heal all manner of sickness. The names of the twelve apostles are listed, beginning with Simon Peter and ending with Judas Iscariot. Jesus sends them forth, commanding them to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and to preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. He tells them to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out devils, saying, freely ye have received, freely give.

He warns them, Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. He tells them to beware of men, for they will be delivered up to councils and scourged. He says brother shall deliver up brother to death, and they shall be hated of all men for his name's sake, but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. He saith that whosoever shall confess him before men, him will he confess also before his Father, but whosoever shall deny him before men, him will he also deny.

## Matthew 11: John the Baptist's Question and Jesus's Testimony

When John hears in prison of the works of Christ, he sends two of his disciples to ask, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? Jesus tells them to go and shew John again those things which they do hear and see: how the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up. As they depart, Jesus speaks to the multitudes concerning John, saying that among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist. He then upbraids the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done—Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum—because they repented not.

At that time, Jesus prays, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. He declares that all things are delivered unto him of his Father. He then invites, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He tells them to take his yoke upon them and learn of him, for his yoke is easy, and his burden is light.

## Matthew 12: Lord of the Sabbath and a House Divided

Jesus goes on the sabbath day through the corn, and his disciples pluck the ears of corn and eat. The Pharisees say this is not lawful. Jesus defends them, saying the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. In their synagogue, he heals a man with a withered hand, saying it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. The Pharisees hold a council against him, how they might destroy him. Then is brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb, and he heals him. The Pharisees say, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, warns that a kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation.

He saith that all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven. Certain of the scribes and Pharisees ask for a sign. He answers that no sign shall be given to an evil and adulterous generation, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. While he yet talks to the people, his mother and his brethren stand without, desiring to speak with him. He stretches forth his hand toward his disciples and says, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

## Matthew 13: Parables of the Kingdom

Jesus sits by the sea side, and great multitudes gather, so he goes into a ship and speaks many things unto them in parables. He tells the parable of the sower, whose seed falls on different types of ground. His disciples ask why he speaks in parables, and he answers that it is given unto them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to others it is not given. He then explains the parable of the sower to them.

He puts forth other parables, likening the kingdom of heaven to a man who sowed good seed, but his enemy sowed tares among the wheat; to a grain of mustard seed; and to leaven. He speaks all these things in parables. Later, in the house, he declares unto his disciples the parable of the tares. He tells more parables, likening the kingdom to treasure hid in a field, to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, and to a net cast into the sea. When he comes to his own country, he teaches in their synagogue, but they are offended, saying, Is not this the carpenter's son? And he does not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

## Matthew 14: The Death of John the Baptist and the Feeding of the Five Thousand

Herod the tetrarch hears of the fame of Jesus and says, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead. For Herod had laid hold on John and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. On Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias dances and pleases Herod. Being instructed of her mother, she says, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. The king commands it to be given her. John's disciples take up the body, bury it, and go and tell Jesus.

When Jesus hears of it, he departs by ship into a desert place apart. The people follow him on foot. Jesus is moved with compassion and heals their sick. When it is evening, he is told to send the multitude away. He saith, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. They have but five loaves and two fishes. He commands the multitude to sit down on the grass, takes the food, blesses, and breaks it, and gives it to the disciples to distribute. They all eat and are filled, and they take up of the fragments twelve baskets full. They that had eaten are about five thousand men, beside women and children. Straightway, Jesus constrains his disciples to get into a ship. In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus goes unto them, walking on the sea. Peter walks on the water to go to Jesus but begins to sink. Jesus catches him. When they come into the ship, the wind ceases, and they worship him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

## Matthew 15: The Tradition of the Elders and the Faith of a Canaanite Woman

Scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem ask Jesus why his disciples transgress the tradition of the elders by not washing their hands. Jesus answers, asking why they transgress the commandment of God by their tradition. He calls them hypocrites and says that not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth. Jesus then departs into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. A woman of Canaan cries unto him for her daughter, who is grievously vexed with a devil. After testing her, Jesus answers, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter is made whole from that very hour.

Jesus departs from thence and comes nigh unto the sea of Galilee, and great multitudes come unto him with those that are lame, blind, dumb, and maimed, and he heals them. He then calls his disciples and, having compassion on the multitude, feeds four thousand men, beside women and children, with seven loaves and a few little fishes. They take up of the broken meat that is left seven baskets full. He sends away the multitude and takes ship.

## Matthew 16: The Leaven of the Pharisees and Peter's Confession

The Pharisees and Sadducees come, and tempting, desire a sign from heaven. He calls them a wicked and adulterous generation that seeks after a sign, and says no sign shall be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. He tells his disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, which they understand to be their doctrine.

When Jesus comes into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asks his disciples, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? They give various answers. He asks, But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answers, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus blesses him, saying flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto him, but his Father which is in heaven. He says that upon this rock he will build his church. From that time forth, Jesus begins to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem, suffer many things, be killed, and be raised again the third day. Peter rebukes him, but Jesus saith unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan. Jesus then tells his disciples that if any man will come after him, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow him.

## Matthew 17: The Transfiguration and a Lunatick Son

After six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother up into an high mountain apart and is transfigured before them. His face shines as the sun, and his raiment is white as the light. Moses and Elias appear, talking with him. A bright cloud overshadows them, and a voice out of the cloud says, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. The disciples fall on their face, sore afraid. As they come down from the mountain, Jesus charges them to tell the vision to no man until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.

When they come to the multitude, a man asks Jesus to have mercy on his son, for he is lunatick and sore vexed. Jesus rebukes the devil, and he departs out of him, and the child is cured. The disciples ask why they could not cast him out. Jesus saith unto them, Because of your unbelief. While they abide in Galilee, Jesus tells them the Son of man shall be betrayed and killed, and the third day he shall be raised again. In Capernaum, Jesus provides tribute money for himself and Peter from the mouth of a fish.

## Matthew 18: Humility and Forgiveness

The disciples ask Jesus, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Jesus calls a little child and says that except they be converted and become as little children, they shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. He tells the parable of the man with an hundred sheep who leaves the ninety and nine to seek the one which is gone astray. He gives instructions on dealing with a trespassing brother. Peter asks how oft he should forgive his brother. Jesus answers, Until seventy times seven.

He then tells the parable of the king who forgives a servant a debt of ten thousand talents. But the same servant goes out and finds a fellowservant who owes him an hundred pence and casts him into prison. When the lord hears of this, he is wroth and delivers the unforgiving servant to the tormentors. Jesus concludes, So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

## Matthew 19: Marriage, Divorce, and the Rich Young Ruler

Jesus comes into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan. The Pharisees tempt him, asking if it is lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause. Jesus answers, What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. They bring little children to him. The disciples rebuke them, but Jesus says, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

A young man asks what good thing he shall do to have eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments. The young man says he has kept all these. Jesus tells him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor... and come and follow me. But when the young man hears that, he goes away sorrowful, for he has great possessions. Jesus tells his disciples that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. Peter asks what they shall have, who have forsaken all. Jesus promises they shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

## Matthew 20: The Labourers and a Request for Greatness

Jesus tells the parable of the householder who hires labourers for his vineyard, paying them all a penny, whether they worked one hour or the whole day. He concludes, So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. As Jesus goes up to Jerusalem, he tells the twelve that the Son of man shall be betrayed, condemned to death, delivered to the Gentiles, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.

The mother of Zebedee's children comes with her sons, desiring that they may sit on his right and left hand in his kingdom. Jesus tells them this is not his to give. When the ten hear it, they are moved with indignation. Jesus tells them that whosoever will be great among them shall be their minister, even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. As they depart from Jericho, two blind men cry out for mercy. Jesus has compassion, touches their eyes, and immediately their eyes receive sight, and they follow him.

## Matthew 21: The Triumphal Entry and Parables of Rejection

When they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, Jesus sends two disciples to bring him an ass and a colt. A very great multitude spreads their garments and branches in the way, crying, Hosanna to the son of David. When he is come into Jerusalem, all the city is moved. Jesus goes into the temple and casts out all them that sold and bought, and overthrows the tables of the moneychangers. In the morning, he finds a fig tree with only leaves and says, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withers away.

In the temple, the chief priests and elders ask by what authority he does these things. Jesus answers with a question about the baptism of John, which they cannot answer. He then tells the parable of the two sons and the parable of the wicked husbandmen who kill the servants and the son of the householder. The chief priests and Pharisees perceive that he spake of them and seek to lay hands on him, but they fear the multitude.

## Matthew 22: The Wedding Feast and Entangling Questions

Jesus speaks in parables, likening the kingdom of heaven to a king who made a marriage for his son, but those bidden would not come. The king then invites guests from the highways. He sees a man without a wedding garment and has him cast into outer darkness. The Pharisees take counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. They send their disciples with the Herodians to ask if it is lawful to give tribute unto Caesar. Jesus asks for the tribute money and saith, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.

The Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, ask a question about a woman who had seven husbands. Jesus tells them they do err, not knowing the scriptures. A lawyer from the Pharisees asks which is the great commandment. Jesus answers, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Jesus then asks the Pharisees what they think of Christ, whose son is he? They say, The son of David. He asks how then David in spirit calls him Lord. And no man is able to answer him a word.

## Matthew 23: Woes to the Scribes and Pharisees

Jesus speaks to the multitude, saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat, so they should do as they say, but not after their works. He then pronounces a series of woes upon them, calling them hypocrites and blind guides. He condemns them for shutting up the kingdom of heaven, for their greed, for their manipulative oaths, and for tithing mint and anise and cummin while omitting the weightier matters of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith. He likens them to whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones. He concludes by lamenting over Jerusalem, saying, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets... how often would I have gathered thy children together... and ye would not! He declares, Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

## Matthew 24: The Olivet Discourse—Signs of the End

Jesus departs from the temple and tells his disciples there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. As he sits upon the mount of Olives, the disciples ask, what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? Jesus tells them to take heed that no man deceive them. He speaks of wars and rumours of wars, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes, calling them the beginning of sorrows. He warns of the abomination of desolation, of great tribulation, and that after those days the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light. Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and they shall see him coming in the clouds with power and great glory. He tells them to learn a parable of the fig tree, but that of that day and hour knoweth no man, but his Father only. He warns them to watch therefore, for they know not what hour their Lord doth come.

## Matthew 25: Parables of Watchfulness and Judgment

Jesus continues, likening the kingdom of heaven to ten virgins: five wise who took oil for their lamps, and five foolish who took none. While the bridegroom tarries, the foolish virgins' lamps go out. While they go to buy oil, the bridegroom comes, and the door is shut. He tells them, Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour. He then tells the parable of the talents, where a man gives talents to three servants. The two who trade with their talents are rewarded, but the unprofitable servant who hid his talent is cast into outer darkness.

He then describes the judgment when the Son of man shall come in his glory and separate the nations as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. The King shall say to the sheep on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, for they ministered to him. But to the goats on the left, he shall say, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, for they did not minister to him. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

## Matthew 26: The Last Supper and Jesus's Arrest

Jesus tells his disciples that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. The chief priests and elders consult to take Jesus by subtilty and kill him. In Bethany, a woman anoints Jesus with a box of very precious ointment. Judas Iscariot then goes to the chief priests and covenants with them for thirty pieces of silver to betray Jesus. On the first day of the feast, Jesus and his disciples prepare and eat the passover. As they eat, Jesus saith, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. He answereth, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. Jesus then takes bread and the cup, calling them his body and his blood of the new testament. After an hymn, they go to the mount of Olives. In Gethsemane, Jesus prays in agony while his disciples sleep.

While he yet speaks, Judas comes with a great multitude, and he betrays Jesus with a kiss. They lay hands on Jesus and take him. One of Jesus's company draws his sword and strikes a servant of the high priest, but Jesus tells him to put up his sword. All the disciples forsake him and flee. They lead Jesus away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the council seeks false witness. Jesus holds his peace until the high priest adjures him to say whether he be the Christ. Jesus saith, Thou hast said. The high priest rends his clothes, and they condemn him as guilty of death. Peter, sitting without, denies three times that he knows Jesus. Immediately the cock crows, and Peter goes out and weeps bitterly.

## Matthew 27: The Crucifixion and Burial of Jesus

When the morning is come, the chief priests and elders deliver Jesus to Pontius Pilate the governor. Judas repents, casts down the thirty pieces of silver in the temple, and goes and hangs himself. Jesus stands before Pilate, who asks, Art thou the King of the Jews? Jesus answers, Thou sayest. At that feast, the governor is wont to release a prisoner. They have then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. The chief priests and elders persuade the multitude to ask for Barabbas. Pilate asks what he shall do with Jesus, and they cry, Let him be crucified. Pilate washes his hands, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person, and releases Barabbas. He scourges Jesus and delivers him to be crucified.

The soldiers strip Jesus, put on him a scarlet robe, and plat a crown of thorns. They mock him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! As they come out, they find a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and him they compel to bear his cross. They come to Golgotha and crucify him, and part his garments, casting lots. They set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Two thieves are crucified with him. From the sixth hour there is darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. About the ninth hour, Jesus cries with a loud voice and yields up the ghost. The veil of the temple is rent in twain, and the earth did quake. The centurion and they that were with him fear greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. Joseph of Arimathaea begs the body of Jesus from Pilate, wraps it in a clean linen cloth, and lays it in his own new tomb. The chief priests and Pharisees make the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting a watch.

## Matthew 28: The Resurrection and the Great Commission

In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary come to see the sepulchre. There is a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descends, rolls back the stone, and sits upon it. His countenance is like lightning. For fear of him, the keepers do shake and become as dead men. The angel tells the women, Fear not ye... He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. He tells them to go quickly and tell his disciples. They depart quickly with fear and great joy. As they go, Jesus meets them, saying, All hail. They hold him by the feet and worship him.

Some of the watch shew the chief priests all that was done. They give large money to the soldiers, telling them to say his disciples came by night and stole him away while they slept. Then the eleven disciples go away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. When they see him, they worship him, but some doubt. Jesus comes and speaks unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
