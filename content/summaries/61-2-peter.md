# 2 Peter

## 1: Growing in faith

Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, writes to those who have obtained a like precious faith. He begins with a greeting of grace and peace through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord. Peter states that God's divine power has given them all things that pertain to life and godliness, including exceedingly great and precious promises, so that they may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. He exhorts them to give all diligence to add to their faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love. If these qualities are theirs and abound, they will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Peter emphasizes the importance of making their calling and election sure, for in doing so, they will never stumble and will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom. Knowing that his death is near, Peter is diligent to remind them of these things, so that they will always have a reminder of them after his departure. He affirms that they did not follow cunningly devised fables, but were eyewitnesses of Christ's majesty, referring to the transfiguration when they heard the voice from heaven declare, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." He concludes the chapter by stressing that the word of prophecy is more sure, and that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.

## 2: False teachers

Peter warns that just as there were false prophets in the past, there will be false teachers among them, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction. Many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. With covetousness they will exploit the believers with deceptive words. Their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber. Peter provides historical examples of God's judgment: He did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell; He did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, while bringing in the flood; and He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, making them an example, while delivering righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked. The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust for the day of judgment. These false teachers are described as presumptuous, self-willed, and not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries. They are like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, who speak evil of the things they do not understand. They have eyes full of adultery, are experts in covetousness, and have forsaken the right way, following the way of Balaam. They are wells without water and clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. They speak great swelling words of emptiness, and while they promise liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption. Peter concludes with a stark warning: it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then turn from the holy commandment, fulfilling the proverb, "A dog returns to his own vomit," and, "a sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."

## 3: Day of the Lord

In this second letter, Peter seeks to stir up their pure minds by way of reminder, that they should be mindful of the words of the holy prophets and the commandment of the apostles. He warns that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts and questioning the promise of Christ's coming, claiming that all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. These scoffers willfully forget that by God's word the heavens were made and the earth was formed out of water and by water, through which the world of that time perished, being flooded with water. The present heavens and earth are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. Peter reminds them that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, but is longsuffering, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. In light of this, he asks what manner of persons they ought to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God. According to His promise, they look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, they should be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless. He concludes by urging them to beware lest they also fall from their own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked, but to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
