# Genesis

## Genesis 1: Creation

God creates the heaven and the earth, and the earth is without form and void, covered in darkness as His Spirit moves upon the waters. He speaks light into existence, separates it from darkness, and names them Day and Night. He divides the waters with a firmament called Heaven, gathers the lower waters to reveal dry land called Earth, and commands the earth to bring forth grass, herbs, and fruit trees yielding seed after their kind. He sets the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament to divide day from night, to give light, and to mark seasons, days, and years. He fills the waters with living creatures and the air with fowl, blessing them to multiply, then creates cattle, creeping things, and beasts of the earth. Finally, He creates man in His own image, male and female, gives them dominion over all living things, and appoints every herb and tree for food, and He sees that all He has made is very good.

## Genesis 2: The Garden of Eden

God finishes His work and rests on the seventh day, blessing and sanctifying it. He forms man from the dust of the ground and breathes into him the breath of life, making him a living soul. God plants a garden eastward in Eden, causes every pleasant and good tree to grow there, including the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and places the man in the garden to dress and keep it. He commands the man not to eat of the tree of knowledge, warning that in the day he eats, he shall surely die. Seeing that it is not good for man to be alone, God forms every beast and fowl and brings them to Adam to name, yet none is found suitable for him. God causes a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, takes one of his ribs, makes a woman, and brings her to the man, and they are naked and not ashamed.

## Genesis 3: The Fall

The serpent speaks to the woman, questioning God's command and denying the certainty of death, saying she shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. The woman sees that the tree is good for food and pleasant to the eyes, takes and eats, and gives also to her husband, and he eats. Their eyes are opened; they know they are naked and sew fig leaves together. When God calls to Adam, he confesses hiding in fear, blames the woman, and she blames the serpent. God pronounces judgment upon the serpent, the woman, and the man, declares enmity, sorrow, pain, and toil, and drives them out of Eden, placing cherubims and a flaming sword to guard the way to the tree of life.

## Genesis 4: Cain and Abel

Adam and Eve bear Cain and Abel; Abel keeps sheep and Cain tills the ground. Both bring offerings to the LORD, and He respects Abel's offering but not Cain's, and Cain becomes angry. God warns Cain that sin lies at the door, yet Cain rises up and kills Abel in the field. When questioned, Cain denies knowledge, and God declares Abel's blood cries from the ground, curses Cain from the earth, and makes him a fugitive. Cain fears being slain, and God sets a mark upon him for protection. Cain builds a city and names it after his son Enoch; his descendants include Jabal, Jubal, and Tubalcain. Adam and Eve bear Seth, and in his days men begin to call upon the name of the LORD.

## Genesis 5: Adam to Noah

This chapter records the generations from Adam to Noah, stating that Adam begets Seth and lives many years before dying. Seth begets Enos, and the line continues through Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, and Enoch. Enoch walks with God and is not, for God takes him. Methuselah, Lamech, and then Noah are born, each living many years. Lamech names his son Noah, saying he shall comfort them concerning their work and toil because of the ground the LORD has cursed. The chapter ends by stating that Noah begets Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6: Noah and the Ark

Men multiply upon the earth, and the sons of God take wives of the daughters of men. God limits man's days to one hundred and twenty years, and giants are in the earth in those days. The LORD sees that man's wickedness is great and every imagination of his heart is evil continually, and He repents that He has made man. He determines to destroy man and beast, but Noah finds grace in His eyes. Noah is just and walks with God. God commands Noah to build an ark of gopher wood, gives detailed instructions, and establishes His covenant with him, directing him to bring his family and two of every living thing into the ark to preserve life.

## Genesis 7: The Flood

God commands Noah to enter the ark with his household and take clean and unclean animals as instructed. After seven days, the flood begins as the fountains of the deep break up and the windows of heaven open. Rain falls forty days and nights, and the waters prevail, lifting the ark above the earth. All flesh that breathes dies; every living substance is destroyed from the face of the ground. The waters prevail upon the earth one hundred and fifty days. Only Noah and those with him in the ark remain alive.

## Genesis 8: The Waters Subside

God remembers Noah and all in the ark and causes a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters begin to subside. The fountains of the deep and windows of heaven are stopped, and the waters decrease. The ark rests upon the mountains of Ararat, and the tops of mountains appear. Noah sends forth a raven and then a dove; the dove returns, later brings an olive leaf, and finally does not return. God commands Noah to go forth with his family and the animals. Noah builds an altar and offers burnt offerings, and the LORD smells a sweet savour and promises not again to curse the ground for man's sake nor smite every living thing as He has done.

## Genesis 9: Covenant and Noah's Sons

God blesses Noah and his sons, commanding them to be fruitful and multiply and giving them dominion over the creatures, permitting them to eat flesh but forbidding blood. He institutes the requirement that whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. God establishes His covenant with Noah and every living creature, setting the bow in the cloud as a token that waters shall not again become a flood to destroy all flesh. Noah plants a vineyard, drinks of the wine, and is uncovered in his tent. Ham sees his father's nakedness and tells his brothers; Shem and Japheth cover him. Noah awakens and pronounces a curse upon Canaan and blessings upon Shem and Japheth.

## Genesis 10: The Nations

This chapter lists the generations of Noah's sons after the flood. The descendants of Japheth spread into the isles of the Gentiles. The sons of Ham include Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan; Cush begets Nimrod, a mighty hunter and king over Babel and other cities. The sons of Shem are also recorded, including Arphaxad, Eber, and Joktan. Nations divide in their lands, after their tongues, families, and nations. The chapter sets the foundation for the spread of peoples across the earth.

## Genesis 11: Babel and Abram's Line

The whole earth is of one language, and men journey east and settle in the land of Shinar, resolving to build a city and a tower reaching to heaven to make a name for themselves. The LORD comes down, sees their work, and confounds their language so they cannot understand one another. He scatters them over the face of all the earth, and the city is called Babel. The chapter then records the generations from Shem to Abram through Arphaxad, Salah, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, and Terah. Terah begets Abram, Nahor, and Haran; Haran dies, and Abram marries Sarai. Terah takes Abram and Lot toward Canaan but settles in Haran, where he dies.

## Genesis 12: Abram's Call

The LORD calls Abram to leave his country and kindred and promises to make of him a great nation, to bless him, and that in him all families of the earth shall be blessed. Abram departs with Sarai and Lot and comes into the land of Canaan, where the LORD appears and promises the land to his seed. Abram builds altars and journeys south, but a famine drives him into Egypt. Fearing for his life, he asks Sarai to say she is his sister; Pharaoh takes her into his house. The LORD plagues Pharaoh's house, and Pharaoh returns Sarai and sends Abram away with possessions.

## Genesis 13: Abram and Lot Separate

Abram returns from Egypt with wealth in cattle, silver, and gold, and Lot also prospers. Strife arises between their herdsmen because the land cannot support them together. Abram proposes separation, allowing Lot to choose first; Lot selects the plain of Jordan toward Sodom, while Abram dwells in Canaan. After Lot departs, the LORD reaffirms His promise to Abram, telling him to lift his eyes and look upon all the land, for it shall be given to him and his seed forever. Abram moves his tent and builds an altar unto the LORD in Hebron.

## Genesis 14: Abram Rescues Lot

Four kings from the east wage war against five kings of the plain, including the king of Sodom, and Lot is taken captive. Abram arms his trained servants, pursues the invaders, defeats them by night, and rescues Lot and the goods. Melchizedek king of Salem brings forth bread and wine, blesses Abram, and Abram gives him tithes of all. The king of Sodom offers Abram the goods, but Abram refuses, saying he will not take anything lest the king say he made Abram rich. Abram returns the goods but keeps what his young men have eaten and the portion for his allies.

## Genesis 15: The Covenant

The word of the LORD comes to Abram in a vision, telling him not to fear and promising a great reward. Abram expresses concern that he has no child, and God declares that one from his own body shall be his heir and that his seed shall be as numerous as the stars. Abram believes the LORD, and it is counted to him for righteousness. God instructs Abram to prepare animals for a covenant; a deep sleep falls upon him, and God foretells that his seed shall be strangers in a land not theirs and afflicted four hundred years but shall return. A smoking furnace and burning lamp pass between the pieces, and God makes a covenant granting the land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates.

## Genesis 16: Hagar and Ishmael

Sarai, being barren, gives her maid Hagar to Abram to obtain children by her. Hagar conceives and despises Sarai; Sarai deals hardly with her, and Hagar flees. The angel of the LORD finds Hagar in the wilderness, tells her to return and submit, and promises that her seed shall multiply exceedingly. He declares that she shall bear a son named Ishmael, who shall be a wild man, and his hand shall be against every man. Hagar calls the name of the LORD who speaks to her and returns. Ishmael is born when Abram is eighty-six years old.

## Genesis 17: Abraham and Circumcision

When Abram is ninety-nine, the LORD appears, calls Himself Almighty God, and commands Abram to walk before Him and be perfect. He establishes His covenant, changes Abram's name to Abraham and Sarai's to Sarah, and promises that she shall bear a son. God institutes circumcision as the sign of the covenant, commanding every male to be circumcised. Abraham laughs at the promise but prays for Ishmael; God declares that Sarah shall bear Isaac, and His covenant shall be with Isaac, though He will bless Ishmael. Abraham circumcises himself, Ishmael, and all males in his house that same day.

## Genesis 18: Hospitality and Sodom

The LORD appears to Abraham by the plains of Mamre as three men, and Abraham shows hospitality, preparing food for them. They promise that Sarah shall have a son at the set time; Sarah laughs within herself, and the LORD questions her laughter. The men rise to go toward Sodom, and the LORD reveals to Abraham His intention to judge the city for its great sin. Abraham intercedes, asking if the city would be spared for the sake of the righteous, and the LORD agrees to spare it if ten righteous are found.

## Genesis 19: Sodom and Gomorrah

Two angels come to Sodom, and Lot receives them into his house. The men of the city surround the house and demand the visitors; the angels strike them with blindness. They urge Lot to gather his family and flee, for the LORD will destroy the city. Lot hesitates but is brought out; fire and brimstone rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah, overthrowing the cities and all the plain. Lot's wife looks back and becomes a pillar of salt. Lot dwells in a cave with his daughters, who bear sons by him, named Moab and Benammi.

## Genesis 20: Abraham and Abimelech

Abraham sojourns in Gerar and again says Sarah is his sister; Abimelech king of Gerar takes her. God appears to Abimelech in a dream, warning him that Sarah is a married woman. Abimelech pleads innocence, and God tells him to restore Sarah to Abraham, who is a prophet and shall pray for him. Abimelech returns Sarah, gives gifts, and rebukes Abraham. Abraham prays, and God heals Abimelech, his wife, and maidservants so they bear children, for the LORD had closed their wombs.

## Genesis 21: Isaac and Ishmael

The LORD visits Sarah as promised, and she bears Isaac in her old age. Abraham circumcises Isaac on the eighth day, and Sarah rejoices. When Isaac is weaned, Sarah sees Ishmael mocking and tells Abraham to cast out Hagar and her son. God tells Abraham to heed Sarah, for in Isaac shall his seed be called, but He will make a nation of Ishmael also. Hagar wanders in the wilderness, and God hears the lad's voice, provides water, and reaffirms His promise. Abimelech makes a covenant with Abraham at Beersheba, and Abraham plants a grove there.

## Genesis 22: The Sacrifice of Isaac

God tests Abraham, commanding him to offer Isaac as a burnt offering in the land of Moriah. Abraham rises early, takes Isaac and the wood, and journeys to the appointed place. Isaac asks about the lamb, and Abraham says God will provide Himself a lamb. Abraham binds Isaac and stretches forth his hand, but the angel of the LORD calls to him to stop. A ram caught in a thicket is offered instead, and God swears by Himself to bless Abraham and multiply his seed because he obeys.

## Genesis 23: Sarah's Death and Burial

Sarah dies in Kirjatharba, and Abraham mourns for her. He speaks to the sons of Heth to purchase a burial place and negotiates with Ephron for the cave of Machpelah. Ephron offers the field, but Abraham insists on paying the full price. The field and cave are confirmed to Abraham for a possession in the presence of witnesses. Abraham buries Sarah there.

## Genesis 24: Rebekah for Isaac

Abraham charges his servant to seek a wife for Isaac from his kindred and not from the daughters of Canaan. The servant travels to Mesopotamia and prays for guidance, asking that the appointed woman offer water to him and his camels. Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel, fulfills the sign, and the servant gives her gifts and recounts his mission to her family. Her family consents, and Rebekah departs with the servant. Isaac meets her in the field; she becomes his wife, and he loves her and is comforted after his mother's death.

## Genesis 25: Abraham's Death and Jacob and Esau

Abraham takes another wife, Keturah, and has additional sons but gives all he has to Isaac and sends the sons of the concubines away. Abraham dies at a good old age and is buried by Isaac and Ishmael in the cave of Machpelah. The generations of Ishmael are listed, naming his twelve sons and their settlements. Isaac prays for Rebekah, who conceives twins; the children struggle within her, and the LORD tells her two nations are in her womb and the elder shall serve the younger. Esau is born first, red and hairy, then Jacob. Esau sells his birthright to Jacob for bread and pottage of lentiles.

## Genesis 26: Isaac in Gerar

There is a famine in the land, and Isaac goes to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines. The LORD appears to him and tells him not to go down into Egypt but to dwell in the land He shows him, promising to perform the oath sworn to Abraham and to multiply his seed for Abraham's obedience. Isaac remains in Gerar and says Rebekah is his sister, fearing the men of the place, but Abimelech sees Isaac sporting with her and rebukes him, commanding the people not to touch them. Isaac sows in that land and receives a hundredfold, growing very great so that the Philistines envy him and stop the wells Abraham's servants dug. Isaac reopens those wells and digs others, naming them Esek and Sitnah because of strife, and then Rehoboth when he finds room; afterward he goes to Beersheba, where the LORD appears again and renews the promise. Abimelech comes to make a covenant, and they swear peace, and Isaac's servants find water the same day.

## Genesis 27: Jacob Steals the Blessing

Isaac grows old and his eyes grow dim, and he calls Esau to hunt venison so he may bless him before he dies. Rebekah hears and instructs Jacob to bring goats so she can prepare savory meat like Isaac loves, and she clothes Jacob in Esau's garments and puts skins on his hands and neck. Jacob deceives Isaac, who questions the voice but feels the hairy hands and smells the garments, and he blesses him with abundance, dominion, and the blessing of Abraham. As soon as Jacob leaves, Esau returns and discovers the deception, crying with a great cry and pleading for a blessing. Isaac confirms that Jacob shall be blessed, yet he gives Esau a lesser blessing, foretelling that he shall live by the sword and break his brother's yoke from off his neck. Esau hates Jacob and plans to kill him after Isaac's death, so Rebekah sends Jacob away to Laban in Haran.

## Genesis 28: Jacob's Dream at Bethel

Isaac calls Jacob, blesses him again, and charges him not to take a wife of the daughters of Canaan but to go to Padan-aram to Laban and take a wife from there. He gives him the blessing of Abraham, that he may inherit the land God gave to Abraham. Esau sees that the daughters of Canaan displease Isaac and takes Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, to wife. Jacob departs toward Haran and lodges in a certain place, using stones for pillows. He dreams of a ladder set up on the earth reaching to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it, and the LORD standing above it, promising him the land, countless seed, and presence wherever he goes. Jacob awakes in fear, calls the place Bethel, sets up the stone as a pillar, pours oil upon it, and vows that if God keeps him and brings him back in peace, the LORD shall be his God.

## Genesis 29: Jacob, Rachel, and Leah

Jacob arrives in the land of the people of the east and meets shepherds by a well, learning they know Laban. Rachel comes with her father's sheep, and Jacob rolls away the stone, waters the flock, and weeps when he tells her he is Rebekah's son. Laban receives him and after a month agrees that Jacob will serve seven years for Rachel, whom he loves, and the years seem to him but a few days. When the time is fulfilled, Laban gathers a feast but gives Leah instead of Rachel, and Jacob discovers it in the morning. Laban requires another seven years for Rachel, and Jacob fulfills the week and receives Rachel also, loving her more than Leah. The LORD sees that Leah is hated and opens her womb, and she bears Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, while Rachel remains barren.

## Genesis 30: Jacob's Children and Flocks

Rachel envies Leah and gives her maid Bilhah to Jacob, and Bilhah bears Dan and Naphtali. Leah, seeing she has left bearing, gives her maid Zilpah, who bears Gad and Asher. Leah later bears Issachar and Zebulun and a daughter Dinah, while Rachel prays and God remembers her, opening her womb so she bears Joseph. Jacob asks Laban to let him depart with his wives and children, but Laban persuades him to stay and sets wages. They agree that Jacob shall have the speckled and spotted cattle, and Jacob sets rods before the flocks, so the stronger cattle bear marked young, and the feebler remain Laban's. Jacob increases exceedingly, having much cattle, maidservants, menservants, camels, and asses.

## Genesis 31: Jacob Flees from Laban

Jacob sees Laban's countenance changed and hears his sons say he has taken their father's wealth. The LORD tells Jacob to return to the land of his fathers, and Jacob calls Rachel and Leah to the field, recounting Laban's deceit and God's protection, and they agree to depart. Jacob flees secretly while Laban is shearing sheep, and Rachel steals her father's images. Laban pursues and overtakes them in Mount Gilead, but God warns him in a dream not to speak good or bad to Jacob. Laban accuses Jacob of theft and stealing his gods, but he finds nothing, for Rachel hides them; Jacob rebukes Laban for his hardship and lack of wages. They make a covenant, set up a heap of stones called Galeed and Mizpah, and swear peace, and Laban returns to his place.

## Genesis 32: Jacob Wrestles with God

Jacob goes on his way, and the angels of God meet him, and he calls the place Mahanaim. Hearing that Esau comes to meet him with four hundred men, Jacob divides his people and flocks into two bands and prays for deliverance, reminding God of His promise. He sends a large present ahead in waves to appease Esau. That night he sends his family over the brook Jabbok and remains alone, where a man wrestles with him until the breaking of the day. The man touches the hollow of his thigh, and Jacob's thigh is out of joint, yet he refuses to let go without a blessing. He is named Israel, for as a prince he has power with God and with men, and he calls the place Peniel, for he sees God face to face and lives.

## Genesis 33: Jacob Meets Esau

Jacob lifts up his eyes and sees Esau coming, and he divides the children among Leah, Rachel, and the handmaids. He bows himself to the ground seven times as he approaches Esau. Esau runs to meet him, embraces him, falls on his neck, and they weep. Esau asks about the people and the droves sent before, and Jacob explains they are to find grace in his sight; Esau at first refuses the present but then takes it. Jacob declines Esau's offer to journey together, saying the children and flocks are tender, and promises to follow slowly. Esau returns to Seir, and Jacob journeys to Succoth and then to Shalem, where he buys a parcel of a field and erects an altar, calling it El-elohe-Israel.

## Genesis 34: Dinah and Shechem

Dinah, the daughter of Leah, goes out to see the daughters of the land, and Shechem the son of Hamor sees her, takes her, and lies with her. His soul cleaves to Dinah, and he asks his father to get her for a wife. Hamor speaks with Jacob, proposing intermarriage and trade, but Jacob's sons answer deceitfully, requiring that every male among them be circumcised. Hamor and Shechem persuade their men, promising wealth and union. On the third day, while they are sore, Simeon and Levi take their swords, slay all the males, kill Shechem and Hamor, and take Dinah from Shechem's house. The sons of Jacob spoil the city, taking flocks, herds, goods, and captives. Jacob rebukes Simeon and Levi for making him stink among the inhabitants, fearing retaliation, but they answer that Shechem treated their sister as a harlot.

## Genesis 35: Bethel and Rachel's Death

God tells Jacob to arise and go to Bethel and dwell there and make an altar. Jacob commands his household to put away strange gods and be clean, and they give him their earrings and idols, which he hides under an oak. They journey, and the terror of God is upon the cities round about. At Bethel Jacob builds an altar, and God appears to him again, confirming his name Israel and repeating the promise of a nation and kings from his loins and the land given to Abraham and Isaac. Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, dies and is buried beneath Bethel. As they journey from Bethel, Rachel travaileth and bears Benjamin, dying in childbirth; Jacob sets a pillar upon her grave. Reuben lies with Bilhah, and Israel hears of it, and the chapter lists the twelve sons of Jacob; Isaac dies and Esau and Jacob bury him.

## Genesis 36: Esau's Descendants

This chapter records the generations of Esau, who is Edom. Esau takes wives of the daughters of Canaan and of Ishmael, and his sons are born in Canaan before he moves to mount Seir. Because their substance is too great to dwell together, Esau departs from Jacob and settles in Seir. The chapter lists the sons of Esau, the dukes that come of his line, and the inhabitants of Seir whom Esau's descendants possess. It also names the kings who reign in the land of Edom before any king reigns over the children of Israel. The genealogy establishes the chiefs, families, and territories of Edom.

## Genesis 37: Joseph Sold into Egypt

Joseph, seventeen years old, feeds the flock with his brethren and brings an evil report of them to his father. Israel loves Joseph more than all his children because he is the son of his old age and makes him a coat of many colors, and his brethren hate him and cannot speak peaceably to him. Joseph dreams that his sheaf arises and stands upright while theirs bow down, and again that the sun, moon, and eleven stars make obeisance to him, and he tells his brethren and his father. His brethren envy him, though his father observes the saying. They conspire against him when he comes to them in Dothan, cast him into a pit, and sell him to Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver. They dip his coat in blood and bring it to Jacob, who believes a wild beast devoured him and mourns many days, while Joseph is sold in Egypt to Potiphar.

## Genesis 38: Judah and Tamar

Judah departs from his brethren and marries the daughter of Shuah, and she bears Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er is wicked before the LORD and dies, and Judah commands Onan to raise seed to his brother, but Onan spills it on the ground and is slain also. Judah delays giving Shelah to Tamar, fearing he will die likewise, and Tamar remains a widow. When Judah's wife dies, Tamar disguises herself as a harlot by the way to Timnath, and Judah lies with her, leaving his signet, bracelets, and staff as pledge. She conceives, and when her pregnancy is discovered, Judah orders her brought forth to be burned, but she sends the tokens, saying by the man whose these are she is with child. Judah acknowledges she is more righteous than he, for he gave her not to Shelah. Tamar bears twins, Pharez and Zarah.

## Genesis 39: Joseph and Potiphar's Wife

Joseph is brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar buys him, and the LORD is with Joseph so that all he does prospers. Potiphar sees that the LORD makes his work prosper and sets him over his house, and the blessing of the LORD is upon all he has. Joseph is handsome, and his master's wife casts her eyes upon him and urges him to lie with her, but he refuses, saying it would be sin against God. She persists daily, and one day she catches him by his garment, but he flees, leaving it in her hand. She accuses him falsely of seeking to lie with her, and Potiphar's anger is kindled, and Joseph is cast into prison. Yet the LORD is with Joseph and gives him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison, who commits all the prisoners to his hand.

## Genesis 40: The Butler and the Baker

In prison, the chief butler and chief baker of Pharaoh offend their lord and are put into the ward where Joseph is. Each has a dream in one night, and Joseph sees they are sad and asks the interpretation, saying interpretations belong to God. The butler dreams of a vine with three branches that bud and bring forth grapes, and he presses them into Pharaoh's cup; Joseph interprets that in three days he shall be restored to his office and asks him to remember him. The baker tells his dream of three baskets on his head with baked goods eaten by birds, and Joseph interprets that in three days Pharaoh shall lift up his head from off him and hang him on a tree. On the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, it is so: the butler is restored and the baker hanged. Yet the chief butler forgets Joseph.

## Genesis 41: Joseph Before Pharaoh

After two full years, Pharaoh dreams of seven well-favored kine devoured by seven ill-favored kine, and seven full ears consumed by seven thin ears, and his spirit is troubled. The chief butler remembers Joseph and recounts his interpretation in prison. Joseph is brought before Pharaoh, says God shall give an answer of peace, and interprets the dreams as seven years of great plenty followed by seven years of grievous famine. He advises Pharaoh to set a wise man over the land to gather the fifth part during the plentiful years. Pharaoh discerns the Spirit of God in Joseph, sets him over all Egypt, gives him his ring, and names him Zaphnath-paaneah, and he marries Asenath, daughter of Potipherah priest of On. Joseph gathers corn during the seven years, and when famine comes upon all lands, the people cry to Pharaoh, who directs them to Joseph, and all countries come into Egypt to buy corn.

## Genesis 42: Joseph's Brothers in Egypt

The famine reaches Canaan, and Jacob sends ten sons to buy corn in Egypt, keeping Benjamin back. Joseph sees his brethren, recognizes them, but they know him not, and he speaks roughly to them, accusing them of being spies. They protest they are true men and speak of their father and youngest brother. Joseph confines them three days and then keeps Simeon bound, commanding them to bring Benjamin as proof. He returns their money secretly in their sacks, and they are afraid when they discover it on the way. They recount the events to Jacob, who mourns and refuses to let Benjamin go, fearing harm will befall him.

## Genesis 43: Benjamin Brought to Egypt

The famine is sore in the land, and Judah urges Jacob to send Benjamin, pledging himself surety. Jacob sends them with double money and gifts, committing Benjamin to God's mercy. Joseph sees Benjamin with them and commands his steward to bring them into his house and make ready a feast. The brethren fear because of the returned money, but the steward reassures them and brings out Simeon. Joseph enters, and they bow before him; he asks of their father's welfare and sees Benjamin, and his bowels yearn upon his brother, and he weeps in a private place. He sets them at table according to their birth order and sends portions from before him, giving Benjamin five times as much, and they drink and are merry with him.

## Genesis 44: The Silver Cup

Joseph commands his steward to fill the men's sacks with food and put every man's money in his sack's mouth and his silver cup in Benjamin's sack. After they depart, Joseph sends after them, accusing them of repaying good with evil. They deny the charge and declare that with whomsoever the cup is found, let him die and the rest be bondmen. The cup is found in Benjamin's sack, and they rend their clothes and return to the city. Judah speaks before Joseph, recounting their father's love for Benjamin and the pledge he made, and he offers himself as a servant instead of the lad lest he see the evil that would come upon his father. Joseph tests their unity and hears Judah's plea.

## Genesis 45: Joseph Reveals Himself

Joseph cannot refrain himself and commands all Egyptians to go out, and he weeps aloud and makes himself known to his brethren, saying, I am Joseph. They are troubled at his presence, but he tells them not to be grieved nor angry with themselves, for God sent him before them to preserve life. He explains that the famine shall last yet five years and that God sent him to preserve a posterity in the earth. He urges them to go up to Canaan, tell Jacob that Joseph is lord of all Egypt, and bring him down to dwell in Goshen. He falls upon Benjamin's neck and weeps, and kisses all his brethren, and afterward they talk with him. Pharaoh hears and is pleased, commanding that they be given wagons and the good of the land of Egypt.

## Genesis 46: Jacob Goes to Egypt

Jacob sees the wagons and revives, and he journeys with all that he has to Beersheba, offering sacrifices. God speaks to Israel in the visions of the night, telling him not to fear to go down into Egypt, for He will make of him a great nation there and will bring him up again. Jacob rises and goes into Egypt with his sons and their families, and the chapter lists the names of those who come with him, totaling seventy souls. Joseph goes up to meet Israel his father in Goshen, and they fall on each other's neck and weep a good while. Joseph instructs his brethren to tell Pharaoh they are shepherds, so they may dwell in Goshen.

## Genesis 47: Jacob in Egypt

Joseph presents five of his brethren and his father before Pharaoh, and Pharaoh grants them the land of Goshen. Jacob blesses Pharaoh and declares the days of his pilgrimage to be few and evil. The famine continues, and Joseph gathers all the money in Egypt and Canaan for corn, then their cattle, and finally their land, so that the people become servants to Pharaoh, and he sets a law of the fifth part for Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests is not sold. Israel dwells in Goshen and grows and multiplies. As Jacob's days draw near to die, he calls Joseph and makes him swear to bury him with his fathers in the cave of Machpelah.

## Genesis 48: Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh

Joseph takes Manasseh and Ephraim to Jacob, who strengthens himself upon the bed. Jacob recounts God's appearance at Luz and the promise of the land, and he adopts Ephraim and Manasseh as his own, granting them a portion among his sons. Joseph positions Manasseh at Jacob's right hand and Ephraim at his left, but Jacob crosses his hands, placing his right hand upon Ephraim the younger. Joseph tries to correct him, but Jacob refuses, saying his younger brother shall be greater and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. He blesses them in the name of the God before whom Abraham and Isaac walked and gives Joseph one portion above his brethren.

## Genesis 49: Jacob's Prophecies

Jacob calls his sons to gather that he may tell them what shall befall them in the last days. He speaks to each son in turn, declaring their character and future: Reuben unstable as water; Simeon and Levi instruments of cruelty; Judah praised by his brethren and ruler among them; Zebulun dwelling by the sea; Issachar strong but serving; Dan judging his people; Gad overcoming at the last; Asher yielding royal dainties; Naphtali giving goodly words; Joseph fruitful and blessed above his brethren; Benjamin ravening as a wolf. He blesses them according to their tribes and charges them to bury him in the cave of Machpelah with Abraham and Isaac. When he finishes commanding them, he gathers up his feet into the bed and yields up the ghost.

## Genesis 50: Jacob's Burial and Joseph's Death

Joseph falls upon his father's face, weeps, and commands the physicians to embalm Israel, and the Egyptians mourn seventy days. Joseph asks Pharaoh for leave to bury his father in Canaan, and he goes up with a great company of Egyptians and his brethren, and they mourn at the threshingfloor of Atad. They bury Jacob in the cave of Machpelah as he commanded. After Jacob's death, Joseph's brethren fear he will requite them for the evil they did, and they send a message asking forgiveness; Joseph weeps and assures them he will nourish them and their little ones, saying they meant evil against him but God meant it unto good to save much people alive. Joseph dwells in Egypt, sees Ephraim's children to the third generation, and before he dies he makes the children of Israel swear to carry up his bones from Egypt, and he is embalmed and put in a coffin.
