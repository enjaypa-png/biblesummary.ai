# Genesis

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth in six days. He separated light from darkness, the waters from the sky, and the sea from the dry land. He brought forth vegetation, the sun, moon, and stars, and all living creatures. On the sixth day, God created mankind in His own image, male and female, and gave them dominion over the earth. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, resting from His work. God formed man from the dust of the ground, breathing life into him, and placed him in the Garden of Eden. There, He gave man the command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Seeing that it was not good for man to be alone, God created woman from one of the man's ribs. They were naked and unashamed.

A serpent deceived the woman into eating the forbidden fruit, and she gave some to her husband. Their eyes were opened, and they realized their nakedness, covering themselves with fig leaves. When God confronted them, the man blamed the woman, and the woman blamed the serpent. God cursed the serpent, pronounced pain in childbirth for the woman, and a life of toil for the man. He then banished them from the Garden of Eden, placing cherubim and a flaming sword to guard the way to the tree of life.

Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel. Cain, a farmer, and Abel, a shepherd, both brought offerings to God. God favored Abel's offering, and Cain, in a jealous rage, killed his brother. As punishment, God condemned Cain to be a restless wanderer. Adam and Eve had another son, Seth, and from his line came Noah. As humanity multiplied, so did wickedness, and God regretted creating mankind. He decided to send a great flood to destroy all life, but Noah found favor in His eyes. God instructed Noah to build an ark and to take his family and pairs of every animal aboard.

For forty days and nights, rain fell, and the waters covered the earth, destroying all life except for those in the ark. After the floodwaters receded, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. Noah sent out a raven and a dove, and when the dove returned with an olive leaf, he knew the waters had subsided. God commanded them to leave the ark and blessed Noah and his sons, promising never again to destroy all life with a flood, setting a rainbow in the sky as a sign of His covenant. The descendants of Noah's sons—Shem, Ham, and Japheth—repopulated the earth.

At a place called Babel, the people, who all spoke one language, began to build a tower to reach the heavens. God, seeing their pride, confused their language and scattered them across the face of the earth. From the line of Shem came Abram. God called Abram to leave his home and go to a land He would show him, promising to make him a great nation. Abram, with his wife Sarai and nephew Lot, traveled to Canaan. A famine forced them to Egypt, where Abram, fearing for his life, had Sarai say she was his sister. Pharaoh took her into his palace, but God sent plagues, and Pharaoh, upon learning the truth, sent them away.

Abram and Lot separated due to their large flocks, with Lot choosing the plain of Jordan near Sodom. God renewed His promise to Abram, and in a covenant ceremony, foretold that Abram's descendants would be enslaved for four hundred years but would eventually be delivered. Sarai, being barren, gave her Egyptian slave Hagar to Abram, and Hagar bore Ishmael. When Abram was ninety-nine, God changed his name to Abraham and Sarai's to Sarah, promising them a son, Isaac, and establishing circumcision as the sign of the covenant.

Three divine visitors came to Abraham and announced that Sarah would have a son within a year. Sarah, being old, laughed in disbelief. The visitors then turned their attention to the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham pleaded with God to spare the cities for the sake of the righteous, and God agreed to spare them if even ten righteous people could be found. Two angels went to Sodom and were met by Lot, who offered them hospitality. The men of the city surrounded Lot's house, demanding to have sex with the visitors. The angels struck the men with blindness and urged Lot and his family to flee, warning them not to look back. As God rained down fire and sulfur on the cities, Lot's wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot and his two daughters escaped to the mountains, where his daughters, believing they were the last people on earth, got their father drunk and conceived children by him, who became the ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites.

As promised, Sarah gave birth to Isaac in her old age. At Sarah's insistence, Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away, but God promised to make a great nation of Ishmael as well. God then tested Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham obeyed, but at the last moment, an angel stopped him, and a ram was provided for the sacrifice instead. Sarah died, and Abraham purchased a cave in Machpelah as a family burial plot.

Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac from among his relatives. The servant found Rebekah, who returned with him and married Isaac. Rebekah was barren, but Isaac prayed, and she conceived twins, Esau and Jacob. Esau, the firstborn, was a hunter, while Jacob was a quiet man. One day, Esau, faint with hunger, sold his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of stew. Later, with Rebekah's help, Jacob deceived his blind father, Isaac, and received the blessing intended for Esau. Enraged, Esau planned to kill Jacob, who fled to his uncle Laban's house in Harran. On his journey, Jacob dreamed of a stairway to heaven and received a renewal of God's covenant promises.

Jacob fell in love with Laban's daughter Rachel and worked for seven years to marry her, only to be tricked into marrying her older sister, Leah. He then worked another seven years for Rachel. Leah bore him many sons, while Rachel was barren. Rachel gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob, and Leah gave her servant Zilpah to him, and they also bore him sons. Finally, God remembered Rachel, and she gave birth to Joseph. Jacob prospered greatly while working for Laban, but after twenty years, God told him to return to his homeland. Jacob left secretly with his family and flocks. Laban pursued him, but they made a covenant and parted peacefully.

As Jacob prepared to meet Esau, he wrestled with a man until daybreak, who changed his name to Israel. The meeting with Esau was one of reconciliation and forgiveness. Jacob settled in Canaan, where his daughter Dinah was raped by Shechem, the son of a local ruler. Dinah's brothers, Simeon and Levi, took revenge by killing all the men of Shechem's city.

Jacob's favorite son, Joseph, was given a richly ornamented robe, which made his brothers jealous. Joseph had two dreams that foretold his future greatness, which only increased their hatred. They sold him into slavery and led their father to believe he had been killed by a wild animal. Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh. God was with Joseph, and he prospered, but Potiphar's wife falsely accused him of attempted rape, and he was thrown into prison. In prison, Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker. Two years later, Pharaoh had troubling dreams, and the cupbearer remembered Joseph. Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dreams, predicting seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh was so impressed that he made Joseph the second-in-command of all Egypt.

During the famine, Jacob sent his ten older sons to Egypt to buy grain. They appeared before Joseph, who recognized them, but they did not recognize him. He accused them of being spies and demanded they bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to prove their innocence. On their second journey, they brought Benjamin, and Joseph, after testing them, revealed his identity. He forgave them, saying that what they had intended for evil, God had intended for good. Joseph sent for his father and their entire family to come and live in Egypt, in the land of Goshen.

Jacob and his family, seventy in all, settled in Egypt. Before his death, Jacob blessed his twelve sons, giving a special blessing to Judah, from whom the scepter would not depart, and to Joseph. He also adopted Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, giving the greater blessing to the younger, Ephraim. Jacob died and was buried in the family tomb in Canaan. After Jacob's death, Joseph's brothers feared he would take revenge, but Joseph reassured them of his forgiveness. Joseph lived to be 110 years old, and before he died, he made the Israelites swear to carry his bones with them when God would bring them out of Egypt and back to the promised land.
