## Malachi 1: The LORD's Love for Israel and Rebuke of the Priests

The burden of the word of the LORD comes by Malachi to Israel. The LORD declares His love for Israel, contrasting Jacob and Esau. He states that He loves Jacob but lays Esau's mountains and heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Though Edom says it will rebuild, the LORD of hosts says He will throw it down, and they will be called the border of wickedness. Israel will see this and say the LORD is magnified beyond the border of Israel.

The LORD then addresses the priests. He says a son honors his father and a servant his master, and asks where His honor and fear are. The priests despise His name by offering polluted bread on His altar. They present blind, lame, and sick animals for sacrifice. He challenges them to offer such things to their governor and see if he would accept them. He declares that from the rising of the sun to its setting His name will be great among the Gentiles, but the priests profane it. He says He has no pleasure in them and will not accept their offering.

## Malachi 2: The Covenant with Levi and Treachery in Marriage

The LORD commands the priests to listen. If they do not lay His commandment to heart, He will send a curse upon them and corrupt their blessings. He reminds them of His covenant with Levi, which is life and peace, given in fear and truth. Levi walks with Him in peace and turns many away from iniquity. The priest's lips should keep knowledge, but these priests depart out of the way and cause many to stumble.

The LORD then speaks against Judah. Judah deals treacherously and marries the daughter of a strange god. The LORD says He will cut off the man who does this. He rebukes them for covering the altar with tears because He no longer regards their offering. He says He is witness between a man and the wife of his youth, against whom he deals treacherously. He declares that He hates putting away and commands them to guard their spirit and not deal treacherously.

## Malachi 3: The Messenger and the Refiner

The LORD announces that He sends His messenger, who prepares the way before Him. The Lord will suddenly come to His temple, even the messenger of the covenant. He is like a refiner's fire and a fuller's soap. He sits as a refiner and purifier of silver, purifying the sons of Levi so they may offer an offering in righteousness. He will come near to judgment against sorcerers, adulterers, false swearers, and those who oppress others.

The LORD declares that He does not change; therefore the sons of Jacob are not consumed. He calls them to return to Him. They ask how to return, and He says they rob Him in tithes and offerings. He commands them to bring all the tithes into the storehouse and promises to open the windows of heaven and rebuke the devourer. He hears those who fear Him speak often one to another, and a book of remembrance is written before Him. He says they will be His in the day when He makes up His jewels.

## Malachi 4: The Day of the LORD and Elijah

The day comes that burns like an oven. The proud and all who do wickedly will be stubble, and the day will burn them up. To those who fear the LORD's name, the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in His wings. They will go forth and grow as calves of the stall. The wicked will be ashes under their feet.

The LORD commands them to remember the law of Moses His servant, given in Horeb with statutes and judgments. He promises to send Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the LORD. Elijah will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, so the LORD does not come and strike the earth with a curse.
