## 1-3: Letters to the Seven Churches

John, on the island of Patmos, is instructed by a voice like a trumpet to write what he sees in a book and send it to the seven churches in Asia: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. He sees seven golden candlesticks, and in the midst of them one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, with his head and his hairs white like wool, as white as snow; his eyes as a flame of fire; his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. In his right hand are seven stars, and out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword. He is told that the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.

Each church receives a message of commendation, rebuke, and promise to him that overcomes.

**Ephesus:** Commended for labor and patience, rebuked for leaving their first love, and called to repent and do the first works.

**Smyrna:** Acknowledged for tribulation and poverty (but rich), warned of suffering, and promised a crown of life if faithful unto death.

**Pergamos:** Praised for holding fast the faith where Satan dwells, rebuked for holding the doctrine of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, and called to repent.

**Thyatira:** Commended for works, charity, service, faith, and patience, rebuked for tolerating Jezebel, and told to hold fast till he comes.

**Sardis:** Told they have a name that they live, but are dead, and warned to watch lest he come as a thief.

**Philadelphia:** Acknowledged for keeping my word and not denying my name, and promised preservation from the hour of temptation.

**Laodicea:** Rebuked for being lukewarm, counseled to buy gold tried in the fire, white raiment, and eyesalve. He stands at the door and knocks.

## 4-5: Throne Room Vision

A door is opened in heaven, and John sees a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on it. A rainbow like an emerald encircles the throne. Twenty-four elders sit around it, clothed in white raiment with crowns of gold. Lightnings, thunderings, and voices proceed from the throne. Seven lamps of fire burn before it, which are the seven Spirits of God. Before the throne is a sea of glass like crystal.

Four living creatures full of eyes continually say, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."

A book sealed with seven seals is in the right hand of him that sat on the throne. No one is found worthy to open it, until the Lion of the tribe of Judah appears as a Lamb slain, having seven horns and seven eyes. He takes the book, and heaven proclaims him worthy, for he was slain and redeemed men to God by his blood.

## 6-7: Seven Seals

The Lamb opens the seals:

**First:** A white horse; its rider goes forth conquering.

**Second:** A red horse; peace is taken from the earth.

**Third:** A black horse; balances and famine are proclaimed.

**Fourth:** A pale horse; Death and Hell follow, given power over a fourth of the earth.

**Fifth:** Souls under the altar cry for justice; white robes are given unto every one of them, and they are told to rest for a little season.

**Sixth:** Earthquake, darkened sun, blood moon, falling stars, and terror before the wrath of the Lamb.

Before the seventh seal, 144,000 of the tribes of Israel are sealed. A great multitude from all nations stands before the throne, having washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.

## 8-11: Seven Trumpets

The seventh seal brings silence in heaven for about half an hour. Seven trumpets are given:

**First:** Hail and fire mixed with blood burn a third of the earth.

**Second:** A burning mountain falls into the sea.

**Third:** The star Wormwood makes waters bitter.

**Fourth:** A third of the sun, moon, and stars are darkened.

**Fifth:** The bottomless pit opens; locusts torment men for five months.

**Sixth:** Four angels at Euphrates are released; a third of mankind is slain.

An angel swears that there should be time no longer. John eats the little book -- sweet in the mouth, bitter in the belly.

Two witnesses prophesy 1,260 days. They are slain, and their bodies lie in the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. After three and a half days they are resurrected and ascend to heaven.

**Seventh Trumpet:** "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ."

## 12-14: Dragon, Beasts, and the Lamb

A woman brings forth a man child; a dragon seeks to devour him. War breaks out in heaven, and Satan is cast down.

A beast rises from the sea, given authority for forty-two months. Another beast causes all to receive a mark, without which no one may buy or sell. The number of the beast is 666.

The Lamb stands on Mount Zion with 144,000. Angels proclaim judgment. The harvest of the earth is reaped, and the winepress of God's wrath is trodden.

## 15-16: Seven Bowls

Seven angels pour out the bowls of wrath: sores, blood, scorching heat, darkness, demonic gathering at Armageddon, and finally a great earthquake. A voice declares, "It is done."

## 17-18: Fall of Babylon

Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots, is judged. Kings and merchants mourn her fall. A mighty angel casts a millstone into the sea, declaring her final destruction.

## 19-20: Final Battle and Judgment

Heaven rejoices. The marriage of the Lamb is announced, and the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

Christ rides forth on a white horse. The beast and false prophet are cast into the lake of fire. Satan is bound for a thousand years, released briefly, then cast into the lake of fire forever.

The dead are judged at the great white throne. Whoever is not found written in the Book of Life is cast into the lake of fire.

## 21-22: New Heaven and New Earth

A new heaven and new earth appear. New Jerusalem descends from God. There is no more death, sorrow, or pain. God dwells with his people.

The city has twelve gates and foundations, streets of gold, no temple, and no need of sun or moon, for the Lamb is its light. A river of life flows from the throne, with the tree of life bearing fruit each month.

Jesus testifies: "Surely I come quickly." A warning is given not to add to or take away from the words of this prophecy.
