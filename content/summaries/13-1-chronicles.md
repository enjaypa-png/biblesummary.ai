# 1 Chronicles

## Genealogies (Chs 1–9)

The record begins with the line from Adam to Noah and his sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The descendants of Japheth are listed, followed by the descendants of Ham, which include Nimrod, a mighty one in the earth, and the ancestors of the Philistines. The line of Shem is traced down to Abram, who is Abraham. The sons of Abraham—Ishmael and Isaac—are named, along with the sons of Abraham’s concubine Keturah. The generations of Ishmael are listed, followed by the descendants of Isaac’s son Esau, including the dukes and early kings of Edom.

The narrative then focuses on the twelve sons of Israel. The tribe of Judah receives the most extensive genealogy, tracing the line from his sons Pharez and Zerah down to Jesse, the father of David. The sons of David born in Hebron and Jerusalem are listed, and the royal line is chronicled from Solomon down to the descendants of Jeconiah after the captivity. Additional family lines of Judah are provided, along with the genealogies of Simeon. The records of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who settled east of the Jordan, are detailed, noting their defeat and exile by the Assyrians for their unfaithfulness.

The tribe of Levi is given a similarly detailed and lengthy genealogy, identifying the lines of the high priests descended from Aaron, the families of Gershom, Kohath, and Merari, and the musicians appointed by David. The cities allotted to the Levites throughout Israel are also listed. The genealogies of the remaining northern tribes—Issachar, Benjamin, Naphtali, the western half of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Asher—are recorded. The tribe of Benjamin is given a second, more detailed genealogy, with a specific focus on the lineage of King Saul. The book concludes its genealogical section by listing the first inhabitants of Jerusalem to return from the Babylonian captivity, including priests, Levites, and temple servants, before repeating the genealogy of Saul one final time.

## 1 Chronicles 10

The Philistines fight against Israel, and the men of Israel flee, falling down slain on Mount Gilboa. The Philistines pursue King Saul and his sons, and they kill Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. The battle turns against Saul, and he is wounded by archers. Saul tells his armourbearer to draw his sword and kill him, so the uncircumcised will not abuse him. The armourbearer is afraid and will not, so Saul takes a sword and falls upon it. When the armourbearer sees that Saul is dead, he also falls on his sword and dies. Saul, his three sons, and all his house die together. When the Israelites in the valley see that their army has fled and that Saul and his sons are dead, they abandon their cities. The Philistines then come and dwell in them. The next day, the Philistines come to strip the slain and find Saul and his sons fallen on the mountain. They strip Saul, take his head and his armour, and send them throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the news to their idols and the people. They place his armour in the house of their gods and fasten his head in the temple of Dagon. When the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead hear what the Philistines have done to Saul, their valiant men arise and take away the bodies of Saul and his sons. They bring them to Jabesh, bury their bones under an oak tree, and fast for seven days. Saul dies for his transgression against the word of the Lord and for consulting one with a familiar spirit instead of inquiring of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord slays him and turns the kingdom over to David, the son of Jesse.

## 1 Chronicles 11

All Israel gathers to David at Hebron, declaring that they are his bone and flesh. They recall that even when Saul was king, David was the one who led Israel. They acknowledge that the Lord God told David he would feed and rule over His people. The elders of Israel make a covenant with David in Hebron, and they anoint him king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord through Samuel. David and all Israel go to Jerusalem, also known as Jebus, where the Jebusites inhabit the land. The Jebusites tell David he will not enter the city, but David captures the castle of Zion, which becomes the city of David. David announces that whoever smites the Jebusites first will become chief and captain. Joab, the son of Zeruiah, goes up first and becomes chief. David dwells in the castle and builds up the city, while Joab repairs the rest. David grows greater and greater, for the Lord of hosts is with him.

The account then lists the chief of the mighty men whom David has. Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, is chief of the captains and once lifts his spear against three hundred and slays them. After him is Eleazar the son of Dodo, one of the three mighties, who is with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines gather for battle. He and David stand their ground in a field of barley and defeat the Philistines, and the Lord saves them by a great deliverance. Three of the thirty captains go down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam while the Philistines are encamped in the valley of Rephaim. David is in the hold, and a Philistine garrison is at Bethlehem. David expresses a longing for a drink from the well of Bethlehem. The three mighty men break through the Philistine host, draw water from the well, and bring it to David. David refuses to drink it and instead pours it out to the Lord, saying he cannot drink the blood of men who risked their lives. Abishai, the brother of Joab, is chief of three mighty men; he lifts his spear against three hundred and slays them. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada performs many acts, including slaying two lionlike men of Moab and a five-cubit-tall Egyptian, whom he kills with the Egyptian’s own spear. The chapter concludes with a list of the valiant men of the armies, including Asahel the brother of Joab and Uriah the Hittite.

## 1 Chronicles 12

A list is given of the mighty men who come to David at Ziklag while he is in hiding from Saul the son of Kish. They are armed with bows and can use both their right and left hands to hurl stones and shoot arrows. The first group named are Benjamites, relatives of Saul. Mighty men from the tribe of Gad also separate themselves to join David in his wilderness stronghold; they are described as men of war with faces like lions, as swift as roes upon the mountains. Some men of Benjamin and Judah also come to the hold. David goes out to meet them, asking if they come peaceably to help him or to betray him. The spirit comes upon Amasai, chief of the captains, who declares, “Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.” David then receives them and makes them captains of his band. Men from Manasseh also join David when he is sent away by the lords of the Philistines, who feared he would betray them to Saul. These men of Manasseh help David against raiding bands.

Day by day, more men come to help David, until he has a great host, like the host of God. The record then provides the numbers of armed men who come to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the Lord. The numbers include thousands of men from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, Levi (with Jehoiada the leader of the Aaronites and Zadok, a young man of valor), Benjamin (noting that most of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul), Ephraim, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. From the children of Issachar come men who have understanding of the times and know what Israel ought to do. Tens of thousands of expert warriors who can keep rank and are not of a double heart come from Zebulun, Naphtali, Dan, and Asher. From the other side of the Jordan, from the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, come over a hundred thousand men with all manner of instruments of war. All these men of war come with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel. The rest of Israel is also of one heart to make him king. They remain with David for three days, eating and drinking what their brethren have prepared. People from as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali bring provisions, and there is joy in Israel.

## 1 Chronicles 13

David consults with his captains and every leader. He then says to all the congregation of Israel that if it seems good to them and is of the Lord their God, they should send for their brethren everywhere, including the priests and Levites, to gather together. He proposes that they bring again the ark of God, noting that they did not inquire at it in the days of Saul. The entire congregation agrees, for the thing is right in their eyes. David gathers all Israel, from the Shihor of Egypt to the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. David and all Israel go to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim in Judah, to bring up the ark of God the Lord, who dwells between the cherubims. They set the ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drive the cart. David and all Israel play before God with all their might, with singing and with various musical instruments. When they come to the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza puts forth his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumble. The anger of the Lord is kindled against Uzza, and God smites him because he put his hand to the ark. Uzza dies there before God. David is displeased because the Lord made a breach upon Uzza, and he names the place Perezuzza. David is afraid of God that day and asks how he can bring the ark of God home to him. He does not bring the ark to the city of David but carries it to the house of Obededom the Gittite. The ark of God remains with the family of Obededom for three months, and the Lord blesses his house and all that he has.

## 1 Chronicles 14

Hiram, king of Tyre, sends messengers to David with cedar timbers, masons, and carpenters to build him a house. David perceives that the Lord has confirmed him as king over Israel, for his kingdom is lifted up on high for the sake of his people. David takes more wives at Jerusalem and has more sons and daughters, including Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Elpalet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet. When the Philistines hear that David is anointed king over all Israel, they go up to seek him. David hears of it and goes out against them. The Philistines come and spread out in the valley of Rephaim. David inquires of God, asking if he should go up against the Philistines and if God will deliver them into his hand. The Lord tells him to go up, for He will deliver them. So they go up to Baalperazim, and David defeats them there. David says that God has broken in upon his enemies by his hand like the breaking forth of waters, so they name the place Baalperazim. The Philistines leave their gods there, and David gives a commandment to burn them with fire. The Philistines again spread out in the valley. David inquires of God again, and God tells him not to go up after them but to circle around and attack them in front of the mulberry trees. God instructs him to go out to battle when he hears the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, for God has gone out before him to strike the Philistine army. David does as God commands, and they defeat the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gazer. The fame of David goes out into all lands, and the Lord brings the fear of him upon all nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15

David makes houses for himself in the city of David and prepares a place for the ark of God, pitching a tent for it. He declares that only the Levites should carry the ark, for the Lord has chosen them for this purpose. David gathers all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the ark and assembles the descendants of Aaron and the Levites. He calls for the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and for the chief Levites, telling them to sanctify themselves so they can bring the ark to the place he has prepared. He acknowledges that the Lord made a breach upon them previously because they did not seek Him in the due order. The priests and Levites sanctify themselves, and the Levites carry the ark of God on their shoulders with the staves, as Moses commanded.

David instructs the chief Levites to appoint singers with musical instruments to lift up their voices with joy. The Levites appoint Heman, Asaph, and Ethan as the chief singers, along with their brethren of the second degree. The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan are appointed to sound with cymbals of brass, while others are appointed with psalteries and harps. Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, is in charge of the song because he is skillful. Priests are appointed to blow the trumpets before the ark. David, the elders of Israel, and the captains go to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Obededom with joy. When God helps the Levites carrying the ark, they offer seven bullocks and seven rams. David is clothed in a robe of fine linen, as are all the Levites, the singers, and Chenaniah. David also wears a linen ephod. All Israel brings up the ark with shouting and the sound of cornets, trumpets, and cymbals. As the ark comes to the city of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looks out a window and sees King David dancing and playing, and she despises him in her heart.

## 1 Chronicles 16

They bring the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David has pitched for it, and they offer burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. When David finishes the offerings, he blesses the people in the name of the Lord. He then distributes to every man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. David appoints certain Levites to minister before the ark, to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel. Asaph is the chief, with other Levites playing psalteries, harps, and cymbals, while the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel continually sound trumpets before the ark of the covenant.

On that day, David delivers a psalm of thanksgiving into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. The psalm calls on the people to give thanks to the Lord, to make His deeds known, to sing to Him, and to glory in His holy name. It urges them to seek the Lord and His strength continually and to remember His marvelous works, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth. The psalm recounts God’s everlasting covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and His protection of them as they went from nation to nation, reproving kings for their sakes and saying, “Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.” It calls for all the earth to sing to the Lord and declare His glory among the nations, for He is great and to be feared above all gods, who are mere idols. The psalm declares that glory and honor are in God’s presence. It calls for all people to give the Lord glory and to worship Him in the beauty of holiness. It concludes with a call to give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His mercy endures forever, and with a prayer for salvation from the heathen. All the people say, “Amen,” and praise the Lord.

David leaves Asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work requires. He also appoints Obededom and his brethren as porters. He leaves Zadok the priest and his brethren before the tabernacle of the Lord at the high place in Gibeon to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law. With them are Heman and Jeduthun to give thanks to the Lord. After this, all the people depart to their own houses, and David returns to bless his house.

## 1 Chronicles 17

As David sits in his house, he says to Nathan the prophet that he dwells in a house of cedars while the ark of the covenant of the Lord remains under curtains. Nathan tells David to do all that is in his heart, for God is with him. That same night, the word of God comes to Nathan, instructing him to tell David that he will not be the one to build a house for God to dwell in. God explains that He has never dwelt in a house since bringing Israel up, but has moved from tent to tent. He has never asked any of the judges of Israel to build Him a house of cedars. God tells Nathan to remind David that He took him from the sheepcote to be ruler over Israel, has been with him everywhere, has cut off all his enemies, and has made him a great name. God promises to ordain a place for Israel where they will dwell and no longer be wasted by the children of wickedness. He further tells David that the Lord will build him a house. After David’s life, God will raise up one of his sons, establish his kingdom, and that son will build a house for God. God will establish his throne forever, be his father, and he will be God’s son. God promises not to take His mercy from him as He did from Saul, but will settle him in His house and kingdom forever.

Nathan speaks all these words to David. King David then goes and sits before the Lord. He prays, asking, “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?” He marvels that God has spoken of his house for a great while to come and has regarded him as a man of high degree. David praises God, declaring there is none like Him and no God beside Him. He speaks of Israel as a unique nation whom God redeemed to be His own people. David asks the Lord to let the promise concerning his house be established forever. He prays that God’s name will be magnified and that the house of David will be established before Him. Because God has revealed that He will build him a house, David has found it in his heart to pray. He concludes by asking the Lord to bless the house of his servant, that it may be before Him forever.

## 1 Chronicles 18

After this, David defeats the Philistines, subdues them, and takes Gath and its towns. He also defeats Moab, and the Moabites become David’s servants, bringing him gifts. David then defeats Hadarezer king of Zobah on his way to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. David captures from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. He hamstrings all the chariot horses but reserves one hundred of them. When the Syrians of Damascus come to help Hadarezer, David kills twenty-two thousand of them. He places garrisons in Syria-damascus, and the Syrians become his servants, bringing gifts. The Lord preserves David wherever he goes. David takes the shields of gold from Hadarezer’s servants and brings them to Jerusalem. From Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brings a great quantity of brass, which Solomon later uses to make the brazen sea, the pillars, and other vessels.

When Tou king of Hamath hears that David has defeated the entire army of Hadarezer, he sends his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory, for Hadarezer had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brings with him all manner of vessels of gold, silver, and brass. King David dedicates these items to the Lord, along with the silver and gold he has brought from all the nations he has subdued: Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek. Abishai the son of Zeruiah kills eighteen thousand Edomites in the valley of salt. He puts garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites become David’s servants. The Lord preserves David wherever he goes. David reigns over all Israel, executing judgment and justice for all his people. The chapter concludes by listing his chief officials: Joab the son of Zeruiah is over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud is the recorder; Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar are the priests; Shavsha is the scribe; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada is over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons are chief officials at the king’s side.

## 1 Chronicles 19

Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, dies, and his son Hanun reigns in his place. David decides to show kindness to Hanun because his father showed kindness to him, so he sends messengers to comfort Hanun concerning his father. The Ammonite princes, however, convince Hanun that David has sent the men as spies to search and overthrow the land. Hanun takes David’s servants, shaves them, cuts their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sends them away. When David is told how his men were treated, he sends to meet them, for they are greatly ashamed. The king tells them to remain at Jericho until their beards have grown and then return. The Ammonites realize they have made themselves odious to David, so they hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Syria-maachah, and Zobah. They gather for battle, and when David hears of it, he sends Joab and the entire army of mighty men.

The Ammonites come out and arrange for battle at the city gate, while the allied kings are by themselves in the field. Joab sees that the battle is set against him in front and behind, so he chooses the best of Israel’s soldiers to array against the Syrians. He puts the rest of the people under the command of his brother Abishai to face the Ammonites. Joab devises a plan: if the Syrians are too strong for him, Abishai will help him, and if the Ammonites are too strong for Abishai, Joab will help him. He encourages his brother to be of good courage and to behave valiantly for their people and the cities of their God. Joab and his men draw near to fight the Syrians, who flee before him. When the Ammonites see the Syrians flee, they also flee before Abishai and enter the city. Joab then returns to Jerusalem. The Syrians, seeing they have been defeated, send for more Syrians from beyond the Euphrates, led by Shophach, the captain of Hadarezer’s army. David gathers all Israel, crosses the Jordan, and confronts them in battle. The Syrians flee before Israel, and David’s army kills seven thousand men in chariots, forty thousand footmen, and Shophach the captain of the host. When the servants of Hadarezer see that they are defeated, they make peace with David and become his servants. The Syrians refuse to help the Ammonites any more.

## 1 Chronicles 20

At the time of year when kings go out to battle, Joab leads the army, wastes the country of the Ammonites, and besieges Rabbah, while David remains at Jerusalem. Joab defeats Rabbah and destroys it. David takes the crown from their king’s head, which weighs a talent of gold and contains precious stones, and places it on his own head. He also brings a great amount of spoil out of the city. He brings out the people who were in the city and puts them to work with saws, iron harrows, and axes, dealing with all the cities of the Ammonites in the same manner. David and all the people then return to Jerusalem.

After this, war arises with the Philistines at Gezer. Sibbechai the Hushathite kills Sippai, who is a descendant of the giant, and the Philistines are subdued. In another war with the Philistines, Elhanan the son of Jair kills Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff is like a weaver’s beam. Again, there is war at Gath, where there is a man of great stature with twenty-four fingers and toes, who is also a son of the giant. When he defies Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, kills him. These giants, born in Gath, fall by the hand of David and his servants.

## 1 Chronicles 21

Satan stands up against Israel and provokes David to number the people. David commands Joab and the rulers to go and number Israel from Beersheba to Dan. Joab protests, asking why the king would require this and cause a trespass in Israel, but the king’s word prevails. Joab departs, goes throughout all Israel, and returns to Jerusalem with the numbers: Israel has 1,100,000 men who draw the sword, and Judah has 470,000. Joab does not count Levi and Benjamin because the king’s command is abominable to him. God is displeased with this action and strikes Israel. David confesses to God that he has sinned greatly and acted very foolishly, and he asks for his iniquity to be taken away.

The Lord speaks to Gad, David’s seer, telling him to offer David three choices: three years of famine, three months of destruction by his foes, or three days of the sword of the Lord—a pestilence in the land with the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Gad presents these options to David, who chooses to fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are great, rather than into the hand of man. The Lord sends a pestilence upon Israel, and seventy thousand men die. God sends an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel is destroying, the Lord sees and repents of the evil, telling the angel, “It is enough, stay now thine hand.” The angel of the Lord is standing by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. David lifts up his eyes and sees the angel between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fall on their faces. David speaks to God, taking responsibility for the sin of numbering the people and asking that God’s hand be against him and his father’s house, not against the people.

The angel of the Lord commands Gad to tell David to go up and set up an altar to the Lord at the threshingfloor of Ornan. David goes up as Gad has spoken. Ornan, who is threshing wheat, turns and sees the angel, and his four sons hide. As David approaches, Ornan comes out, bows before him, and David asks to buy the threshingfloor for the full price to build an altar so that the plague may be stopped. Ornan offers to give David the threshingfloor, the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for a meat offering. David insists on buying it for the full price, saying he will not take what is Ornan’s for the Lord or offer burnt offerings that cost him nothing. David gives Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the place. He builds an altar there, offers burnt offerings and peace offerings, and calls upon the Lord. God answers him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. The Lord commands the angel, who puts his sword back into its sheath. At that time, David sacrifices at the threshingfloor of Ornan. The tabernacle of the Lord and the altar of the burnt offering are at the high place at Gibeon, but David cannot go there to inquire of God because he is afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord.

## 1 Chronicles 22

David declares, “This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.” He commands the strangers in the land of Israel to be gathered, and he sets masons to prepare wrought stones for building the house of God. David prepares an abundance of iron for nails and joinings, and so much brass that it cannot be weighed. He also gathers cedar trees in abundance, brought by the Zidonians and the people of Tyre. David says that his son Solomon is young and tender, and the house for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous, and glorious throughout all countries, so he will make preparations for it. David prepares abundantly before his death.

He calls for his son Solomon and charges him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel. David tells Solomon that it was in his mind to build a house for the name of the Lord, but the word of the Lord came to him, saying that because David has shed much blood and made great wars, he will not build the house. God promised David a son who will be a man of rest, and his name will be Solomon. This son will build the house for God’s name; he will be God’s son, and God will be his father, and God will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever. David blesses Solomon, praying that the Lord will be with him, give him wisdom and understanding, and charge him concerning Israel so that he may keep the law of the Lord. David tells Solomon he will prosper if he takes heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments the Lord gave Moses. He encourages him to be strong and of good courage, not to dread or be dismayed. David informs Solomon that in his trouble he has prepared one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight, as well as timber and stone. He tells Solomon he may add to it and that he has abundant workmen. He commands him to arise and be doing, and the Lord will be with him.

David also commands all the princes of Israel to help his son Solomon. He reminds them that the Lord their God is with them and has given them rest on every side by subduing the inhabitants of the land. He exhorts them to set their hearts and souls to seek the Lord their God and to arise and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so they can bring the ark of the covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house built for the name of the Lord.

## 1 Chronicles 23

When David is old and full of days, he makes his son Solomon king over Israel. He gathers all the princes of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites. The Levites aged thirty years and older are numbered, totaling thirty-eight thousand men. Of these, twenty-four thousand are to oversee the work of the house of the Lord, six thousand are to be officers and judges, four thousand are to be porters, and four thousand are to praise the Lord with the instruments David made. David divides the Levites into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. The chapter then lists the chief fathers of the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites.

The sons of Amram, from the line of Kohath, are Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his sons are separated to sanctify the most holy things, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister to Him, and to bless in His name forever. The sons of Moses, the man of God, are named of the tribe of Levi. The descendants of Moses’s sons, Gershom and Eliezer, are listed. The sons of Merari—Mahli and Mushi—are also listed. The sons of Mahli’s son Eleazar, who had no sons, have their cousins, the sons of Kish, take them as wives. The sons of Mushi are Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.

These are the sons of Levi according to their fathers’ houses, the chief of the fathers as they are counted by name, who do the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from the age of twenty years and upward. David states that because the Lord God of Israel has given rest to His people to dwell in Jerusalem forever, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle. By the last words of David, the Levites are numbered from twenty years old and above. Their office is to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the courts and chambers, purifying all holy things, and doing the work of the service of the house of God. This includes responsibility for the shewbread, fine flour, unleavened cakes, and all manner of measure and size. They are to stand every morning and evening to thank and praise the Lord and to offer all burnt sacrifices on the sabbaths, new moons, and set feasts. They are to keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord.

## 1 Chronicles 24

The divisions of the sons of Aaron are recorded. Aaron’s sons are Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Nadab and Abihu die before their father and have no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar execute the priest’s office. David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, distributes them according to their offices. More chief men are found among the sons of Eleazar than of Ithamar. The sons of Eleazar have sixteen chief men, while the sons of Ithamar have eight. They are divided by lot, as the governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of God are from both lines. Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel, a Levite scribe, records the lots before the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the chief fathers of the priests and Levites.

The lots are cast, establishing twenty-four courses for the priestly service. The first lot falls to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, and so on, until all twenty-four lots are assigned. These orderings determine their service in the house of the Lord, following the manner established by their father Aaron, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.

The rest of the sons of Levi are also listed by their families. The sons of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel are named. The sons of Merari are also recorded. These Levites, the chief fathers and their younger brethren alike, also cast lots for their duties in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the chief fathers of the priests and Levites.

## 1 Chronicles 25

David and the captains of the host separate for service the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who are to prophesy with harps, psalteries, and cymbals. The sons of Asaph—Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah—are under the direction of Asaph, who prophesies according to the king’s order. The sons of Jeduthun—Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah—are under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesies with a harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord. The sons of Heman, the king’s seer in the words of God, are also listed: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, and many others. God gives Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. All these are under the direction of their father for the song in the house of the Lord, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king’s order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

The total number of them, with their brethren who are instructed in the songs of the Lord—all who are skilled—is two hundred and eighty-eight. They cast lots for their duties, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the scholar. The lots determine the twenty-four courses of service. The first lot comes forth for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah; the third to Zaccur, and so on, with each of the twenty-four lots assigning a leader and his twelve sons and brethren to a specific course.

## 1 Chronicles 26

This chapter details the divisions of the porters, or gatekeepers. Among the Korhites is Meshelemiah the son of Kore, and his sons are listed. The sons of Obed-edom, who are also Korhites, are described as mighty men of valor, sixty-two in all. Meshelemiah has eighteen strong sons and brethren. From the sons of Merari, Hosah has thirteen sons and brethren, with his son Simri being made chief by his father even though he is not the firstborn. These divisions of porters, chief men with wards, minister in the house of the Lord. They cast lots for every gate, according to their fathers' houses, for both the small and the great. The lot for the east gate falls to Shelemiah. For his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, they cast lots, and his lot comes out as the north gate. The south gate is assigned to Obed-edom, and to his sons the house of Asuppim (the storehouse). The west gate, with the gate Shallecheth, falls to Shuppim and Hosah. The number of Levites assigned to each gate daily is specified.

Other Levites are appointed over the treasures of the house of God and the treasures of the dedicated things. The sons of the Gershonite Laadan, specifically Jehieli and his sons Zetham and Joel, are over the treasures of the house of the Lord. From the other Levitical families, Shebuel, a descendant of Moses, is the ruler of the treasures. His relative Shelomith and his brethren are over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which King David, the chief fathers, and the captains of the army had dedicated from the spoils of battle to maintain the house of the Lord. This includes everything dedicated by Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah. Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons are appointed to the outward business over Israel, as officers and judges. Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, seventeen hundred men of valor, are officers in Israel on the west side of the Jordan, for all the business of the Lord and the service of the king. Jerijah is the chief of the Hebronites. In the fortieth year of David’s reign, mighty men of valor are found among them at Jazer of Gilead. King David makes these two thousand seven hundred chief fathers rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God and the affairs of the king.

## 1 Chronicles 27

The children of Israel are organized into twelve monthly courses of service for the king. Each course consists of twenty-four thousand men, including chief fathers, captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers, who serve for one month each year. The chapter lists the captain for each of the twelve months: Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel for the first month; Dodai the Ahohite for the second; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada for the third; Asahel the brother of Joab for the fourth; Shamhuth the Izrahite for the fifth; Ira the son of Ikkesh for the sixth; Helez the Pelonite for the seventh; Sibbecai the Hushathite for the eighth; Abiezer the Anetothite for the ninth; Maharai the Netophathite for the tenth; Benaiah the Pirathonite for the eleventh; and Heldai the Netophathite for the twelfth.

Following this, the rulers of the tribes of Israel are listed: Eliezer over the Reubenites, Shephatiah over the Simeonites, Hashabiah over the Levites, Zadok over the Aaronites, Elihu over Judah, Omri over Issachar, and so on for all the tribes. The text notes that David did not number the men from twenty years old and under, because the Lord had promised to increase Israel like the stars of heaven. It also mentions that Joab son of Zeruiah began to number the people but did not finish because wrath came upon Israel for it, and the number was not recorded in the chronicles of King David.

The chapter then lists the officials who are over the king’s property. Azmaveth is over the king’s treasures. Jehonathan is over the storehouses in the fields, cities, villages, and castles. Various other officials are named as overseers of the field workers, the vineyards, the wine cellars, the olive and sycamore trees, the cellars of oil, the herds in Sharon and the valleys, the camels, the donkeys, and the flocks. Finally, the king’s personal staff is listed: Jonathan, David’s uncle, is a counselor, wise man, and scribe; Jehiel is with the king’s sons; Ahithophel is the king’s counselor; Hushai the Archite is the king’s companion; and after Ahithophel, Jehoiada and Abiathar are counselors. Joab is the general of the king’s army.

## 1 Chronicles 28

David assembles all the officials of Israel in Jerusalem: the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who minister to the king, the captains of thousands and hundreds, the stewards of the king’s and his sons’ possessions, the officers, and all the mighty and valiant men. King David stands and addresses them, saying it was in his heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, but God told him he would not build it because he has been a man of war and has shed blood. David recounts how the Lord God of Israel chose him to be king over Israel forever, choosing the tribe of Judah, then his father’s house, and then him from among his father’s sons. From all of David’s many sons, the Lord has chosen Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. God told David that Solomon will build His house and courts, for He has chosen him to be His son and will be his father, and He will establish his kingdom forever if he is constant in keeping His commandments.

David charges the assembly, in the sight of all Israel and in the hearing of God, to keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord their God so that they may possess the good land and leave it as an inheritance for their children forever. He then turns to his son Solomon, instructing him to know the God of his father and to serve Him with a perfect heart and a willing mind, for the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. He tells Solomon that if he seeks God, he will be found, but if he forsakes Him, he will be cast off forever. David exhorts him to take heed, for the Lord has chosen him to build a house for the sanctuary, and he must be strong and do it.

David then gives Solomon the pattern for the temple, including the porch, houses, treasuries, upper chambers, inner parlors, and the place of the mercy seat. He gives him the pattern for all that he had by the Spirit for the courts of the house of the Lord, the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries of the dedicated things. He also provides the plans for the courses of the priests and Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and for all the service vessels. He specifies the weight of gold and silver for all the instruments, including the candlesticks, lamps, tables of shewbread, fleshhooks, bowls, cups, and basins. He provides the weight of refined gold for the altar of incense and the gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and cover the ark of the covenant. David states that the Lord made him understand all of this in writing by His hand upon him. He encourages Solomon again to be strong and of good courage, not to fear or be dismayed, for the Lord God will be with him and will not fail him until all the work for the service of the house of the Lord is finished. He assures Solomon that the courses of the priests and Levites, as well as skilled workmen and all the people, will be with him and at his command.

## 1 Chronicles 29

King David addresses the entire congregation, stating that his son Solomon, whom God has chosen, is young and tender, and the work of building the temple is great, for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God. David recounts how he has prepared with all his might for the house of God: gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones, and various other precious stones and marble in abundance. Because he has set his affection on the house of God, he has also given his own personal treasure of gold and silver, over and above all that he has prepared. He then asks the congregation who among them is willing to consecrate their service to the Lord that day. The chief fathers, princes of the tribes, captains, and rulers of the king’s work offer willingly. They give vast amounts of gold, silver, brass, and iron, as well as precious stones, for the service of the house of God. The people rejoice because they offer willingly with a perfect heart, and King David also rejoices with great joy.

David blesses the Lord before all the congregation, praising God’s greatness, power, glory, victory, and majesty. He acknowledges that all things in heaven and on earth are the Lord’s, and that riches and honor come from Him. David and the people give thanks and praise God’s glorious name. He humbly asks, “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?” He confesses that all things come from God and that they have only given back what is already His. He prays that God would keep this willingness in the hearts of the people forever and prepare their hearts for Him. He also prays for his son Solomon, asking God to give him a perfect heart to keep His commandments and to build the palace for which he has made provision. David then instructs the congregation to bless the Lord their God. The entire congregation blesses the Lord God of their fathers, bowing their heads and worshipping the Lord and the king.

The next day, they sacrifice a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs as burnt offerings, along with drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. They eat and drink before the Lord with great gladness. They make Solomon the son of David king a second time, anointing him to the Lord as the chief governor and Zadok as priest. Solomon sits on the throne of the Lord as king in place of his father David, and he prospers, and all Israel obeys him. All the princes, mighty men, and all of David’s sons submit themselves to King Solomon. The Lord magnifies Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestows upon him royal majesty unlike any king before him in Israel. The account concludes by summarizing David’s reign of forty years over Israel. He dies in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon reigns in his stead. The acts of King David, first and last, are written in the books of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer, along with all his reign, his might, and the times that went over him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the countries.
