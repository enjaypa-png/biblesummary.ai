# Titus

## 1: Qualifications for elders

Paul begins his letter by greeting Titus, his true son in their common faith. He reminds Titus that he left him in Crete to put in order what was left unfinished and to appoint elders in every town. Paul then lays out the qualifications for these elders. An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children must be believers who are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. As God's steward, an overseer must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. Paul warns that there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group. Their mouths must be stopped, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain. He quotes a Cretan prophet who said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons." Paul affirms this testimony and instructs Titus to rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.

## 2: Teaching sound doctrine

Titus is instructed to teach what is in accord with sound doctrine. Older men are to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. Likewise, older women are to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. Similarly, young men are to be encouraged to be self-controlled. In everything, Titus is to set them an example by doing what is good. In his teaching, he is to show integrity, seriousness, and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose him may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about them. Slaves are to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive. For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.

## 3: Doing what is good

Titus is to remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone. Paul reminds Titus that at one time they too were foolish, disobedient, deceived, and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. They lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved them, not because of righteous things they had done, but because of his mercy. He saved them through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on them generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, they might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying, and Paul wants Titus to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone. But Titus is to avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. He is to warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, he is to have nothing to do with them. The letter concludes with personal instructions for Titus to meet Paul in Nicopolis, and to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, seeing to it that they have everything they need. Paul encourages the believers to learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not be unfruitful. The letter ends with final greetings and a blessing.
