# Psalms

## Psalm 1: Two Paths

This psalm describes two paths. The blessed person does not follow the counsel of the ungodly, does not stand in the way of sinners, and does not sit among the scornful. Instead, this person delights in the law of the LORD and thinks on it day and night.

That person is compared to a tree planted by streams of water that produces fruit in season and keeps its leaf from withering, and their way prospers. The ungodly are not like that; they are like chaff driven by the wind. The psalm ends by saying the ungodly do not stand in the judgment or remain among the righteous, because the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly perishes.

## Psalm 2: The Anointed King

This psalm speaks about nations and rulers stirring up unrest and setting themselves against the LORD and against his Anointed. They speak as if they can break free from God's rule, as though his bonds can be thrown off.

The LORD who sits in the heavens responds with scorn and speaks in his wrath. He declares his king set upon Zion, and the Anointed speaks of the decree: he is called the Son and is given the nations for an inheritance. The psalm warns kings and judges to be wise, to serve the LORD with fear, and to rejoice with trembling, ending with a call to honor the Son and a statement that blessed are all who trust in him.

## Psalm 3: A Psalm of David (Fleeing from Absalom)

A Psalm of David, when he flees from Absalom his son. David speaks of many enemies rising up against him and many voices saying there is no help for him in God. He describes pressure on every side and the shame those words bring.

David then speaks directly of the LORD as his shield, his glory, and the one who lifts up his head. He says he cries to the LORD and receives an answer from God's holy hill, and he lies down and sleeps because the LORD sustains him. He says he is not afraid though tens of thousands set themselves against him, and he calls on the LORD to arise, asking for deliverance and blessing for God's people.

## Psalm 4: Evening Prayer for Mercy

To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. David calls on the God of his righteousness to hear him when he cries, reminding God that he has been heard before in trouble and asking again for mercy. He addresses people who turn his honor into shame, who love emptiness and seek lies.

He urges them to know the LORD sets apart the godly for himself and that the LORD hears when he calls. He tells them to tremble and not sin, to think quietly in their own hearts, and to bring the sacrifices of righteousness while trusting in the LORD. As others ask who will show them good, David asks for God's light and says God puts gladness in his heart more than the joy of plentiful harvest, and he lies down in peace because the LORD alone makes him dwell safely.

He says in death there is no remembrance of God and in the grave there is no praise, and he describes exhaustion, tears, and a bed washed with weeping. He says his eye grows weak because of grief and age because of enemies. Then his tone shifts as he tells workers of iniquity to depart because the LORD hears his weeping, hears his supplication, and receives his prayer. He ends by saying his enemies are ashamed and troubled and suddenly turn back in shame.

The psalm describes the wicked's speech as full of cursing, deceit, and fraud, and his actions as lurking to catch the helpless like a lion in a thicket.

The LORD speaks in response, saying he rises because of the oppression of the poor and the sighing of the needy, and he sets the needy in safety from those who puff at him. The psalm then describes the words of the LORD as pure words, like silver tried in a furnace and purified.

He says he knows every bird and the wild beasts, and if he were hungry he would not tell them, calling instead for thanksgiving and paying vows. Then God addresses the wicked who recite statutes while hating instruction, consenting with thieves, speaking deceit, slandering family, and thinking God is like them. He warns that he will reprove and set things in order, and he ends by calling for understanding, warning against being torn with none to deliver, and saying whoever offers praise glorifies God, and to the one who orders his conduct rightly God shows salvation.
