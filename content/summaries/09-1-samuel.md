# 1 Samuel

## 1 Samuel 1: The Birth of Samuel

The book opens during the time of the judges, introducing a man named Elkanah with two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. While Peninnah has children, Hannah is barren and is cruelly taunted by her rival. During their annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary at Shiloh, the deeply distressed Hannah prays silently to the Lord, weeping and vowing that if God will give her a son, she will dedicate him to the Lord's service for his entire life as a Nazirite. Eli, the high priest, sees her lips moving and initially mistakes her for a drunken woman, but after she explains her sorrowful prayer, he blesses her, saying, "Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition."

Comforted, Hannah returns home with her husband. In due time, the Lord remembers her, and she conceives and gives birth to a son, whom she names Samuel, meaning "asked of the Lord." True to her vow, once Samuel is weaned, Hannah brings him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh. She presents the young boy to Eli, reminding him of her prayer, and formally gives her son over to the Lord's service. There, the child Samuel begins to minister before the Lord under the care of Eli the priest.

## 1 Samuel 2: Hannah's Song and Eli's Wicked Sons

Hannah offers a beautiful prayer of praise and thanksgiving —a song that rejoices in God's power to reverse human fortunes, exalting the humble, providing for the needy, and bringing down the proud. Her song celebrates the Lord as a God of knowledge and justice who controls life and death, poverty and wealth. It concludes with a prophetic note, looking forward to a time when God will give strength to His king and exalt His anointed one.

The narrative then shifts to contrast the faithfulness of the young Samuel with the corruption of Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. They are described as wicked men who have no regard for the Lord. They abuse their priestly office by taking the best portions of the sacrifices for themselves before the fat is burned for the Lord, and they also commit adultery with the women who serve at the entrance to the tabernacle. Eli, now very old, hears of their evil deeds and gives them a weak rebuke, but he fails to restrain them. A man of God comes to Eli and delivers a prophecy of judgment against his family, announcing that both of his sons will die on the same day and that his priestly line will be cut off from serving God.

## 1 Samuel 3: The Lord Calls Samuel

The young Samuel is ministering under Eli in the temple at Shiloh. In those days, the word of the Lord was rare, and visions were not widespread. One night, as Samuel is lying down, the Lord calls his name. Thinking it is Eli, Samuel runs to the priest, but Eli says he did not call. This happens a second time. The third time the Lord calls, Eli realizes it is the Lord who is calling the boy. He instructs Samuel to answer, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth." When the Lord calls again, Samuel responds as instructed. The Lord then delivers a devastating message to Samuel, confirming the judgment He had pronounced against Eli's house because of the wickedness of his sons and Eli's failure to restrain them.

The next morning, Samuel is afraid to tell Eli the vision, but Eli insists on hearing everything. Upon hearing the news, Eli resigns himself to God's will. As Samuel grows up, the Lord is with him, and all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, recognizes that Samuel is established as a prophet of the Lord. The Lord continues to reveal Himself to Samuel at Shiloh.

## 1 Samuel 4: The Ark of the Covenant Captured

The Israelites go to war against the Philistines but are defeated in the first battle, losing about 4,000 men. The elders of Israel, in a superstitious attempt to secure victory, decide to bring the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh to the battlefield, believing its presence will save them. Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, accompany the Ark to the camp. When the Ark arrives, the Israelites give a mighty shout, which unnerves the Philistines, who have heard of the power of the Israelite God. However, they resolve to fight bravely.

In the ensuing battle, the Israelites are utterly routed, suffering a catastrophic loss of 30,000 foot soldiers. The Ark of God is captured by the Philistines, and both of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are killed, fulfilling the prophecy against Eli's house. A messenger escapes and runs to Shiloh to report the news. When Eli, who is ninety-eight years old and blind, hears that the Ark has been captured, he falls backward off his chair, breaks his neck, and dies. Meanwhile, his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, goes into premature labor upon hearing the news. She gives birth to a son and, as she is dying, names him Ichabod, which means "the glory has departed," for the glory has departed from Israel with the capture of the Ark.

## 1 Samuel 5: The Ark in Philistia

The Philistines take the captured Ark of God to Ashdod, one of their major cities, and place it in the temple of their god, Dagon, setting it up beside the idol. The next morning, the people of Ashdod find the statue of Dagon fallen on its face before the Ark. They set it back in its place. On the second morning, they find Dagon fallen on its face again, but this time its head and hands are broken off, lying on the threshold; only the torso remains. The Lord's hand is heavy against the people of Ashdod, and He brings devastation upon them, afflicting them with tumors.

Realizing the Ark is the cause of their suffering, the leaders of Ashdod decide to move it to another Philistine city, Gath. However, when the Ark arrives in Gath, the Lord's hand is against that city as well, and its people are also afflicted with an outbreak of tumors, causing a great panic. The terrified people of Gath then sent the Ark to Ekron. As the Ark approaches, the people of Ekron cry out in protest, fearing they too will be killed. The plague of tumors strikes them as well, and the city is filled with deathly panic. The Philistine leaders are now desperate to get rid of the Ark of the God of Israel.

## 1 Samuel 6: The Ark Is Returned

After the Ark of the Lord had been in their land for seven months, the Philistines summoned their priests and diviners to ask what they should do with it. They are advised not to send it back empty but to include a guilt offering to the God of Israel. The offering is to consist of five golden tumors and five golden mice, corresponding to the five Philistine rulers and their cities, as a symbolic acknowledgment of the plagues that have afflicted them. To test whether the plagues were truly from the God of Israel or just a coincidence, they are to place the Ark on a new cart pulled by two cows that have just calved and have never been yoked. The calves are to be penned up, away from their mothers.

If the cows, against their natural instinct, go straight toward the Israelite territory of Beth Shemesh, then the Philistines will know the disaster was from the Lord. The cows do exactly that, mooing as they go, and head directly to Beth Shemesh. The people of Beth Shemesh are overjoyed to see the Ark and offer the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. However, their joy turns to mourning when some of the men of the town look inside the Ark, an act of irreverence for which the Lord strikes down seventy of them. Filled with fear, the survivors ask, "Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God?" They then send a message to the people of Kiriath Jearim, asking them to come and take the Ark.

## 1 Samuel 7: Samuel Judges Israel

The men of Kiriath Jearim come and take the Ark of the Lord to the house of Abinadab on a hill, and they consecrate his son Eleazar to guard it. The Ark remains there for twenty years, during which time the people of Israel mourn and seek the Lord. Samuel, now a recognized leader, addresses all of Israel, telling them that if they are truly returning to the Lord, they must put away their foreign gods, the Baals and Ashtaroth, and commit themselves to serve the Lord only. The people obey, and Samuel gathers them at Mizpah for a national assembly of repentance, where they fast, confess their sins, and pour out water before the Lord.

When the Philistines hear that the Israelites are assembled at Mizpah, they march their army to attack them. The terrified Israelites begged Samuel to continue praying for them. As Samuel is sacrificing a burnt offering, the Philistines draw near for battle. The Lord thunders with a mighty sound against them, throwing them into such a panic that they are routed before the Israelites. The Israelites pursue them and defeat them decisively. To commemorate the victory, Samuel sets up a stone between Mizpah and Shen and names it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far the Lord has helped us." The Philistines are subdued and do not invade Israelite territory again for the rest of Samuel's lifetime. Samuel continues to judge Israel, traveling each year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah before returning to his home in Ramah.

## 1 Samuel 8: Israel Demands a King

When Samuel becomes old, he appoints his two sons, Joel and Abijah, as judges over Israel. However, his sons do not follow his example; they are corrupt, accepting bribes and perverting justice. The elders of Israel, dissatisfied with this leadership and desiring to be like the surrounding nations, come to Samuel at Ramah and make a formal demand: "Now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." Samuel is greatly displeased by their request, as he sees it as a rejection of the Lord's direct rule over them. He prays to the Lord about the matter.

The Lord tells Samuel that the people have not rejected him, but they have rejected God as their king. He instructs Samuel to grant their request, but first to give them a solemn warning about the nature of the king who will reign over them. Samuel relays God's warning, describing how the king will conscript their sons for his army, take their daughters for his household, tax their grain and vineyards, and seize their servants and livestock for his own use. He tells them that when that day comes, they will cry out for relief from the king they have chosen, but the Lord will not answer them. Despite the dire warning, the people refuse to listen and insist on having a king to govern them and to lead them in battle. Samuel reports their response to the Lord, who tells him to give them a king.

## 1 Samuel 9: Saul Chosen as King

The narrative introduces Saul, the son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin. He is described as an impressive young man, a head taller than anyone else in Israel. When some of his father's donkeys wander off, Saul and a servant are sent to find them. Their search is long and fruitless, taking them through the hill country of Ephraim and other territories. As they are about to give up and return home, Saul's servant suggests they consult a "man of God," a respected seer who lives in a nearby town. This seer is Samuel.

The day before Saul's arrival, the Lord had revealed to Samuel that He would be sending a man from the tribe of Benjamin, whom Samuel was to anoint as ruler over Israel. When Samuel sees Saul coming, the Lord confirms, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people." Saul approaches Samuel in the town to ask for directions to the seer's house, not knowing he is speaking to the seer himself. Samuel reveals his identity and tells Saul not to worry about the donkeys, as they have been found. He then invites Saul to a special meal, giving him the seat of honor among the guests and serving him the choice portion of the meat. Samuel tells Saul that he and his father's house are the desire of all Israel, hinting at the great destiny that awaits him.

## 1 Samuel 10: Saul Anointed King

The next morning, Samuel takes a flask of oil and anoints Saul, pouring it on his head and kissing him. He declares that the Lord has anointed him as ruler over His inheritance. To confirm this, Samuel gives Saul three prophetic signs that he will encounter on his way home: he will meet two men who will tell him the donkeys have been found; he will then meet three men on their way to Bethel who will offer him two loaves of bread; and finally, upon reaching Gibeah, he will meet a procession of prophets playing musical instruments, and the Spirit of the Lord will come upon him in power, and he will prophesy with them and be changed into a different person. All of these signs come to pass exactly as Samuel had predicted.

Later, Samuel summons all the tribes of Israel to Mizpah for a public ceremony. He rebukes the people for rejecting God, who has saved them from all their calamities, and for demanding a king. He then identifies the chosen king by casting lots. The lot falls to the tribe of Benjamin, then to the clan of Matri, and finally to Saul, son of Kish. When they look for Saul, he is nowhere to be found; he is hiding among the supplies. They bring him out, and he stands a head taller than everyone else. Samuel presents him to the people, saying, "Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." The people shout, "Long live the king!" Samuel explains the regulations of the kingship, writes them in a scroll, and sends everyone home. Saul returns to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God has touched, though some troublemakers despise him and bring him no gifts.

## 1 Samuel 11: Saul's First Victory

Nahash the Ammonite besieges the Israelite city of Jabesh Gilead and offers a humiliating treaty: he will spare the city if every man has his right eye gouged out. The elders of Jabesh ask for seven days to seek help from the rest of Israel. When messengers arrive in Gibeah and tell the news, the people weep aloud. Saul, who is returning from the fields with his oxen, hears the news, and the Spirit of God comes upon him in power. In a dramatic act, he cuts up a pair of oxen and sends the pieces throughout Israel with a warning: "This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel." A sense of dread falls upon the people, and they assemble as one man.

Saul leads the united Israelite army in a surprise attack on the Ammonite camp, routing them completely. After this decisive victory, the people's enthusiasm for Saul is solidified. They want to put to death the men who had initially doubted him, but Saul refuses, declaring that the Lord has brought about a great victory that day. Samuel then leads the people to Gilgal, where they reaffirm Saul's kingship in a public ceremony, offering fellowship offerings and rejoicing greatly.

## 1 Samuel 12: Samuel's Farewell Address

With Saul's kingship reaffirmed, Samuel delivers a farewell address to the nation of Israel. He begins by defending his own integrity, having led them since his youth, and challenges anyone to accuse him of corruption or injustice. The people affirm his blameless leadership. Samuel then recounts Israel's history, reminding them of how the Lord has repeatedly delivered them from their enemies, from Egypt to the present day. He rebukes them for their lack of faith in demanding a king when the Lord their God was their king.

To demonstrate that their demand for a king was wicked in the Lord's sight, Samuel calls on the Lord to send thunder and rain during the wheat harvest, a time when it is normally dry. The Lord does so, and the people are filled with awe and fear, confessing their sin. Samuel reassures them, telling them not to be afraid but to serve the Lord with all their heart. He promises to continue to pray for them and to teach them the way that is good and right. He concludes with a final warning: if they persist in doing evil, both they and their king will be swept away.

## 1 Samuel 13: Saul's Unlawful Sacrifice

Saul had been king for two years when he and his son Jonathan led a small army of 3,000 men. Jonathan attacks a Philistine outpost at Geba, provoking a massive Philistine military response. The Philistines assemble an enormous army, with 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. The terrified Israelite soldiers begin to hide in caves and thickets, and some even flee across the Jordan. Saul is at Gilgal, waiting for Samuel to come and offer sacrifices before the battle, as he had been instructed. He waits for seven days, but Samuel does not arrive, and Saul's men begin to desert him.

Feeling the pressure, Saul takes matters into his own hands and offers the burnt offering himself, an act that is a direct violation of the priestly role and a usurpation of Samuel's authority. Just as he finishes, Samuel arrives and confronts him. Saul makes excuses, blaming the circumstances, but Samuel rebukes him sternly, telling him, "Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God." He announces that Saul's kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after His own heart and has appointed him as the new ruler over His people. Samuel then leaves, and Saul is left with only about 600 men.

## 1 Samuel 14: Jonathan's Faith and Saul's Rash Vow

Jonathan, without telling his father, takes his armor-bearer and secretly approaches a Philistine outpost. Trusting that the Lord can save by many or by few, he proposes a sign: if the Philistines invite them to come up, they will know the Lord has given them into their hands. The Philistines do just that, and Jonathan and his armor-bearer climb up and kill about twenty Philistine soldiers. This act of faith triggers a panic in the Philistine camp, which is amplified by an earthquake sent by God. The Philistine army is thrown into chaos and begins to fight among themselves.

Saul's lookouts see the commotion, and he musters his army to join the battle. In his haste, Saul makes a rash oath, putting a curse on any of his men who eat food before the evening, before he has been fully avenged on his enemies. This foolish vow proves to be counterproductive, as the exhausted and hungry Israelite soldiers are less effective in battle. Unaware of the oath, Jonathan eats some honey he finds in the woods. When he is told of his father's curse, he criticizes the decision, noting how much more decisive their victory could have been if the men had been allowed to eat. That evening, the famished soldiers began to slaughter and eat animals without properly draining the blood, a violation of God's law. When Saul learns that Jonathan has broken the oath, he is prepared to execute his own son, but the soldiers intervene, arguing that Jonathan, who brought about the great victory, should not be put to death. Saul relents, and Jonathan is spared.

## 1 Samuel 15: Saul's Disobedience and Rejection

Samuel comes to Saul with a command from the Lord: he is to completely destroy the Amalekites, putting to death men, women, children, and infants, as well as all their livestock, as a judgment for their opposition to Israel when they came out of Egypt. Saul gathers his army and attacks the Amalekites, defeating them. However, he disobeys the Lord's command by sparing Agag, the king of the Amalekites, and keeping the best of the sheep, cattle, and other livestock. He and his army destroy only what is undesirable and worthless.

The Lord speaks to Samuel, expressing His deep regret that He has made Saul king, for Saul has turned away from Him and has not carried out His instructions. Heartbroken, Samuel confronts Saul, who greets him cheerfully, claiming to have carried out the Lord's command. Samuel questions him about the bleating of sheep and the lowing of cattle he hears. Saul makes excuses, claiming that the soldiers spared the best animals to sacrifice them to the Lord. Samuel delivers a powerful rebuke: "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."

Samuel explains that because Saul has rejected the word and command of the Lord, the Lord has rejected Saul from continuing as God's chosen king over Israel. Although Saul will remain on the throne for a time, God has withdrawn His favor and has already determined that the kingdom will pass to another. As Samuel turns to leave, Saul grabs the edge of Samuel's robe, and it tears. Samuel uses this moment as a sign, explaining that just as the robe has been torn, the Lord has taken the kingdom from Saul in purpose and intention and will give it to another man who will be more faithful than he. Samuel then has Agag brought before him and carries out the execution himself. Afterward, Samuel returns to Ramah and never sees Saul again, though he continues to mourn deeply for him.

## 1 Samuel 16: David Anointed as King

The Lord rebukes Samuel for mourning over Saul and sends him on a secret mission to Bethlehem, to the house of a man named Jesse, for God has chosen one of Jesse's sons to be the next king. Samuel is afraid of what Saul will do if he finds out, but the Lord instructs him to take a heifer and say he has gone to offer a sacrifice. Samuel goes to Bethlehem and consecrates Jesse and his sons. One by one, Jesse presents his sons to Samuel. When Samuel sees the eldest, Eliab, who is tall and handsome, he assumes he must be the one. But the Lord tells Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."

Seven of Jesse's sons are brought before Samuel, but the Lord makes it clear that none of them is the one He has chosen. Samuel asks Jesse if there are any other sons, and Jesse mentions the youngest, David, who is away tending the sheep. They send for him, and when David arrives—described as ruddy, with a pleasing appearance and handsome features—the Lord tells Samuel, "Arise, anoint him: for this is he." Samuel takes the horn of oil and anoints David in the presence of his brothers, marking him as the one God has chosen to be king, though he will not take the throne immediately. From that day forward, the Spirit of the Lord comes upon David with strength and guidance. At the same time, the Spirit of the Lord withdraws from Saul, and Saul begins to suffer from a distressing spirit that troubles him. Saul's servants suggest that music might calm him, and one of them recommends David, who is known not only as a skilled harpist but also as a capable and well-regarded young man. David is brought into Saul's service, and whenever the troubling spirit comes upon Saul, David plays the harp, and Saul is relieved and finds rest.

## 1 Samuel 17: David and Goliath

The Philistines gather their armies for war against Israel, and the two armies face each other on opposite hills in the Valley of Elah. For forty days, a Philistine champion named Goliath, a giant over nine feet tall and clad in heavy bronze armor, comes out and challenges the Israelites to send a champion to fight him in single combat, with the fate of the two nations resting on the outcome. The Israelite army, including Saul, is terrified and dismayed.

Meanwhile, David is sent by his father, Jesse, to bring food to his three oldest brothers, who are in Saul's army. When David arrives at the camp, he hears Goliath's defiant challenge and is indignant that this "uncircumcised Philistine" is allowed to defy the armies of the living God. David's oldest brother, Eliab, rebukes him for his pride, but David, filled with faith, volunteers to fight the giant. He is brought before Saul, who is skeptical but allows him to go. David refuses Saul's armor, finding it cumbersome, and instead goes to meet Goliath armed only with his shepherd's staff, a sling, and five smooth stones from a stream. Goliath scoffs at the young boy, but David declares that he comes in the name of the Lord of hosts. David places a stone in his sling, hurls it, and strikes the giant on the forehead. Goliath falls facedown on the ground. David then runs, takes Goliath's own sword, and kills him, cutting off his head. When the Philistines see that their champion is dead, they turn and flee, and the Israelite army pursues and defeats them.

## 1 Samuel 18: Saul's Jealousy of David

After the victory over Goliath, a deep bond of friendship forms between David and Saul's son, Jonathan. Jonathan loves David as he loves himself, and they make a covenant together. Jonathan gives David his own robe, tunic, sword, bow, and belt as a sign of their friendship. David is highly successful in all the missions Saul sends him on, and he is given a high rank in the army, which pleases both the people and Saul's officials. However, as the army returns from battle, the women come out from the towns, singing and dancing, with a song that says, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."

This song ignites a furious jealousy in Saul, and from that day on, he keeps a watchful and suspicious eye on David. The next day, while David is playing the harp as usual, the evil spirit from God comes upon Saul, and he hurls a spear at David, trying to pin him to the wall. David eludes him twice. Saul becomes afraid of David because he sees that the Lord is with him and has departed from himself. He demotes David and sends him away, but David continues to be successful in all he does. Saul then devises a plot to have David killed by the Philistines, offering him his older daughter, Merab, as a wife in exchange for his military service. However, when the time comes, Saul gives Merab to another man. Saul's younger daughter, Michal, is in love with David, and Saul sees another opportunity. He offers Michal to David in exchange for a bride price of one hundred Philistine foreskins, hoping David will be killed while trying to obtain them. David and his men go out and kill two hundred Philistines, and David presents the foreskins to Saul. Saul has no choice but to give Michal to David as his wife, and his fear and hatred of David only intensify.

## 1 Samuel 19: Saul Tries to Kill David

Saul's jealousy grows into an open obsession, and he speaks to his son Jonathan and all his attendants about his desire to kill David. Jonathan, however, is loyal to his friend and warns David of the danger. He then goes to his father and speaks well of David, reminding Saul of how David risked his life to kill Goliath and brought a great victory to Israel. Saul listens to Jonathan and takes an oath, "As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death." Jonathan brings David back to Saul, and he serves in the court as before.

However, when war breaks out again and David has another great victory against the Philistines, Saul's jealousy is rekindled. Once again, while David is playing the harp, Saul tries to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David escapes into the night. Saul sends men to watch David's house and kill him in the morning. David's wife, Michal, helps him escape through a window. She then deceives her father's soldiers by putting an idol in the bed and covering it with clothes, claiming David is ill. When the deception is discovered, Saul is furious, but Michal lies and says David threatened to kill her if she did not help him. David flees to Samuel at Ramah and tells him everything. When Saul sends men to capture David, they find him with a group of prophets, and the Spirit of God comes upon the soldiers, and they begin to prophesy. This happens two more times. Finally, Saul goes himself, but the Spirit of God comes upon him as well, and he strips off his robes and lies naked all day and all night, prophesying. This gives rise to the saying, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

## 1 Samuel 20: David and Jonathan's Covenant

David flees from Ramah and seeks out Jonathan, asking him, "What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?" Jonathan finds it hard to believe his father would try to kill David without telling him, but David is convinced of the danger. They devise a plan to test Saul's intentions. David will hide in a field for three days, missing the New Moon festival at the king's table. If Saul asks where he is, Jonathan is to say that David has gone to Bethlehem for a family sacrifice. If Saul accepts this, David is safe, but if he becomes angry, they will know he is determined to harm him. David and Jonathan then renew their covenant of friendship, with Jonathan pledging his loyalty to David and his descendants.

At the New Moon festival, Saul notices David's absence but says nothing the first day. On the second day, he asks Jonathan why David is not there. When Jonathan gives the rehearsed excuse, Saul flies into a rage, insults Jonathan and his mother, and declares that as long as David is alive, Jonathan's own claim to the kingdom is not secure. He orders Jonathan to bring David to him, for he must die. When Jonathan defends David, Saul hurls his spear at his own son, proving his murderous intent. The next day, a heartbroken Jonathan goes out to the field where David is hiding. He shoots three arrows as a signal, as they had arranged, and by his words to the boy who retrieves the arrows, he lets David know that he is in mortal danger and must flee. After the boy leaves, David comes out of hiding, and the two friends weep together before David goes into exile.

## 1 Samuel 21: David on the Run

David flees to Nob, to the priest Ahimelech. Desperate and on the run, David lies to the priest, claiming to be on a secret mission for King Saul. He asks for food and is given the consecrated bread, the holy bread of the Presence, as there is no other bread available. Ahimelech gives it to him on the condition that David and his men have kept themselves from women. David also asks for a weapon, and Ahimelech gives him the sword of Goliath, which had been kept in the sanctuary. Unbeknownst to them, Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds, is there that day and witnesses the exchange.

From Nob, David flees to Gath, a major Philistine city and the hometown of Goliath. He hopes to find refuge there, but the servants of King Achish recognize him as the king of the land of Israel, the one about whom the women sang, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands." David becomes terrified that he will be killed. To save his life, he feigns madness, scribbling on the city gates and letting saliva run down his beard. King Achish is disgusted by his behavior and, believing him to be insane, dismisses him, asking, "Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence?"

## 1 Samuel 22: The Massacre at Nob

David escapes from Gath and takes refuge in the cave of Adullam. His family joins him there, and he begins to attract a following of about 400 men who are in distress, in debt, or discontented. He becomes their leader. From there, he goes to Moab to arrange for the safety of his parents. Meanwhile, Saul, who is in Gibeah, learns that David and his men have been located. He is sitting under a tamarisk tree with his spear in his hand, and he accuses his officials of conspiring with David against him.

Doeg the Edomite, who was present at Nob, then informs Saul that he saw Ahimelech the priest helping David, giving him food and the sword of Goliath. Enraged, Saul summons Ahimelech and all the priests of Nob. He accuses Ahimelech of treason, and despite the priest's pleas of innocence, Saul orders his guards to kill the priests of the Lord. The guards refuse to carry out the order. Saul then turns to Doeg the Edomite and commands him to kill the priests. Doeg obeys, striking down eighty-five priests that day. He then goes to Nob, the town of the priests, and puts everyone to the sword—men, women, children, and infants, as well as their livestock. Only one of Ahimelech's sons, Abiathar, escapes. He flees to David and tells him what has happened. David is filled with guilt, realizing his lie to Ahimelech had led to the massacre, and he offers Abiathar his protection.

## 1 Samuel 23: David Saves Keilah and Flees from Saul

David hears that the Philistines are attacking the town of Keilah and looting the threshing floors. He inquires of the Lord whether he should go and fight them, and the Lord tells him to go and save Keilah. David's men are fearful, but David inquires of the Lord a second time and receives the same command. He and his men go to Keilah, defeat the Philistines, and save the town. When Saul learns that David is in a walled city, he sees it as an opportunity to trap him and prepares to besiege the town.

David, using the ephod that Abiathar the priest had brought with him, inquires of the Lord whether Saul will come down to Keilah and whether the citizens of Keilah will betray him and hand him over to Saul. The Lord reveals that Saul is coming and that the people of Keilah will indeed betray him. David and his 600 men immediately leave Keilah and become fugitives again, moving from one hiding place to another in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul relentlessly hunts for him, but the Lord does not deliver David into his hand. In a moment of encouragement, Jonathan seeks out David in the wilderness and strengthens his faith in God, reaffirming that David will be king and that he, Jonathan, will be second to him. The Ziphites, however, go to Saul and offer to betray David's location. Saul blesses them and sends them to confirm David's whereabouts. As Saul and his men close in on David in the Desert of Maon, a messenger arrives with urgent news that the Philistines are raiding the land. Saul is forced to break off his pursuit of David and go to fight the Philistines.

## 1 Samuel 24: David Spares Saul's Life

After dealing with the Philistine raid, Saul resumes his pursuit of David, taking 3,000 chosen men into the wilderness of En Gedi. As Saul is searching, he comes to a cave to relieve himself. Unbeknownst to him, David and his men are hiding in the back of that very cave. David's men see this as a divine opportunity to kill Saul, but David refuses to harm the Lord's anointed. Instead, he secretly creeps up and cuts off a corner of Saul's robe.

Even this act troubles David's conscience. After Saul leaves the cave, David goes out and calls after him, bowing down and showing him the piece of his robe. He uses it as proof that he could have killed Saul but chose not to, demonstrating that he has no evil intent and is not a rebel. Saul is deeply moved by David's mercy and weeps aloud. He acknowledges his own wrongdoing and David's righteousness, admitting that David will surely be king. He makes David swear an oath that he will not cut off Saul's descendants or wipe out his name from his father's family. David gives his oath, and Saul returns home, while David and his men go up to their stronghold.

## 1 Samuel 25: David, Nabal, and Abigail

Samuel dies, and all Israel mourns for him. David moves to the Desert of Paran. There is a wealthy but foolish and ill-tempered man named Nabal, who is shearing his sheep in Carmel. David, whose men have provided protection for Nabal's shepherds and flocks, sends ten of his young men to politely request provisions. Nabal insults David's messengers, scoffs at David's identity, and refuses to share his food. When David hears of Nabal's insolent response, he is enraged and sets out with 400 of his men to destroy Nabal and his entire household.

However, one of Nabal's servants warns Nabal's intelligent and discerning wife, Abigail, of the danger. Abigail quickly gathers a generous supply of food and provisions and, without telling her husband, goes to intercept David. She meets him on the road, bows before him, and delivers a wise and persuasive appeal. She takes the blame for her husband's foolishness, asks for forgiveness, and urges David not to shed innocent blood and tarnish his future kingship with an act of personal vengeance. David is moved by her wisdom and thanks her for keeping him from carrying out his vengeful plan. He accepts her gift and sends her home in peace. When Abigail returns and tells Nabal what has happened, he has a stroke and dies about ten days later. When David hears of Nabal's death, he recognizes it as God's justice. He then sends for Abigail and takes her as his wife.

## 1 Samuel 26: David Spares Saul's Life Again

The Ziphites once again go to Saul and betray David's location, telling him that David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah. Saul takes his 3,000 elite soldiers and goes down to the wilderness to search for him. That night, David and one of his men, Abishai, sneak into Saul's camp while Saul and his entire army are asleep, for the Lord had put them into a deep sleep. Abishai sees another opportunity to kill Saul and asks for permission to strike him down with his own spear, but David again refuses to harm the Lord's anointed.

Instead, David takes the spear and the water jug that are near Saul's head. He and Abishai then leave the camp without anyone knowing. David goes to the top of a nearby hill and calls out to Abner, the commander of Saul's army, rebuking him for failing to protect his king. He then holds up the spear and water jug as proof that he had been in the camp and could have killed Saul. Saul recognizes David's voice and is once again filled with shame and remorse. He confesses his sin, calls himself a fool, and blesses David. He promises not to harm him again. David returns the king's spear and departs, and the two men go their separate ways, never to see each other again.

## 1 Samuel 27: David Among the Philistines

Despite twice sparing Saul's life, David remains convinced that he will one day be killed by him. In a desperate move, he decides to seek refuge in the land of the Philistines. He and his 600 men go to Achish, the king of Gath. Achish, perhaps seeing an advantage in having Israel's most famous warrior as a vassal, welcomes him. When Saul hears that David has fled to Gath, he finally gives up his pursuit. David asks Achish for a town to live in, and Achish gives him the town of Ziklag.

David lives in Philistine territory for a year and four months. During this time, he leads raids on the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites, traditional enemies of Israel. He completely destroys the towns he attacks, leaving no one alive to report what he has done. When he returns to Achish, he deceives the king, leading him to believe that he has been raiding towns in the Negev of Judah and other Israelite territories. Achish trusts David completely, believing that he has made himself odious to his own people and will therefore remain his servant forever.

## 1 Samuel 28: Saul and the Witch of Endor

The Philistines gather their entire army for a major war against Israel, and King Achish tells David that he and his men must fight alongside them. David gives an ambiguous answer, and Achish, trusting him, appoints him as his permanent bodyguard. The Israelite army, led by Saul, camps at Gilboa, and when Saul sees the vast Philistine army, he is terrified. He inquires of the Lord what to do, but the Lord does not answer him—not by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

In desperation, Saul decides to consult a medium, even though he himself had previously expelled all mediums and spiritists from the land. Disguised, he travels by night to Endor to find a woman who is a medium. He asks her to conjure up the spirit of the prophet Samuel. The woman is initially fearful but agrees after Saul swears an oath that no harm will come to her. When the spirit of Samuel appears, the woman recognizes Saul and cries out. Samuel's spirit asks why Saul has disturbed him. Saul explains his desperate situation, with the Philistines attacking and God having abandoned him. Samuel gives him no comfort, only a grim prophecy: the Lord has torn the kingdom from his hand and given it to David; because of his disobedience in the matter of the Amalekites, the Lord will deliver Israel into the hands of the Philistines, and by tomorrow, he and his sons will be dead. Saul collapses in terror and despair.

## 1 Samuel 29: David Is Rejected by the Philistines

As the Philistine army musters for battle, the commanders march their units past the rulers. When they see David and his men in the rear with King Achish, they are outraged. They demand that Achish send David back to Ziklag, arguing that he cannot be trusted in battle. They fear that David will turn against them to regain favor with his former master, Saul. They remind Achish that this is the same David about whom the Israelites sang, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."

Achish, though he personally trusts David and has found no fault in him, is forced to bow to the pressure from his commanders. He summons David and explains the situation, regretfully telling him that he must return to Ziklag in the morning. David protests, asking what he has done wrong, but Achish insists. So, early the next morning, David and his men depart from the Philistine camp and begin their journey back to Ziklag, while the Philistine army marches on to Jezreel for the battle against Israel.

## 1 Samuel 30: David Destroys the Amalekites

When David and his men arrive back in Ziklag after a three-day journey, they find that the town has been raided and burned to the ground by the Amalekites. Their wives, sons, and daughters have all been taken captive. David and his men weep until they have no strength left to weep. David is in great distress, as his own men, bitter with grief, are talking of stoning him. But David finds strength in the Lord his God. He calls for Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod and inquires of the Lord whether he should pursue the Amalekite raiding party. The Lord tells him to pursue them, for he will certainly overtake them and rescue the captives.

David and his 600 men set out, but 200 of them are too exhausted to cross the Besor Valley and are left behind. The remaining 400 continue the pursuit and find an Egyptian in a field, who was a servant of an Amalekite and had been abandoned when he fell ill. After they give him food and water, he agrees to lead them to the Amalekite camp. They find the Amalekites scattered about, eating, drinking, and celebrating. David and his men attack them and fight from dusk until the evening of the next day. They recover everything that was taken—including their wives and children—and also capture a large amount of plunder. David institutes a rule that the men who stayed behind to guard the supplies should share equally in the plunder with those who went into battle. Upon his return, David also sends some of the plunder to the elders of Judah and to the various places where he and his men had roamed.

## 1 Samuel 31: The Death of Saul

The battle between the Philistines and the Israelites takes place on Mount Gilboa, and the Israelites are routed. The Philistines pursue them and kill many, including three of Saul's sons: Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua. The fighting becomes fierce around Saul, and he is critically wounded by the Philistine archers. In his agony, and fearing that the Philistines will capture him and torture him, Saul asks his armor-bearer to kill him with his sword. The armor-bearer is too afraid to do so.

Saul then takes his own sword, places its hilt on the ground, and falls on it. When his armor-bearer sees that Saul is dead, he too falls on his own sword and dies with him. The Israelites who live in the valley see that their army has fled and that Saul and his sons are dead, so they abandon their towns, and the Philistines come and occupy them. The next day, when the Philistines come to strip the dead, they find the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Mount Gilboa. They cut off Saul's head, strip off his armor, and send messengers to proclaim the news in their temples and among their people. They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtaroth and fasten his body to the wall of Beth Shan. When the valiant men of Jabesh Gilead hear what has been done to Saul, they march all night, take down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall, and carry them back to Jabesh. There, they burn the bodies, bury the bones under a tamarisk tree, and fast for seven days in mourning.
