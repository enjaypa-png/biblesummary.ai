# 2 John

The elder writes to the elect lady and her children, whom he loves in the truth. He expresses his joy at finding her children walking in the truth, as commanded by the Father. He reminds her of the commandment they have had from the beginning: to love one another. This love is expressed by walking according to God's commandments.

The elder warns that many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist. He urges them to watch out for themselves, so that they do not lose what they have worked for, but that they may receive a full reward. Anyone who does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God; whoever abides in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son.

He instructs them not to receive anyone into their house or greet anyone who comes to them and does not bring this doctrine, for whoever greets such a person shares in their evil deeds.

The elder concludes that he has many things to write, but would rather not use paper and ink. Instead, he hopes to come and speak with them face to face, so that their joy may be complete. He sends greetings from the children of her elect sister.
