## Ezra 1

In the first year of the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, the Lord stirs his spirit to fulfill the prophecy of Jeremiah. Cyrus makes a proclamation throughout his kingdom and puts it in writing, stating that the Lord God of heaven has given him all the kingdoms of the earth and has charged him to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah. He grants permission for any of God’s people to return to Jerusalem to build the house of the Lord God of Israel, and he encourages those who remain behind to support the returning exiles with silver, gold, goods, and beasts, in addition to a freewill offering for the house of God.

In response, the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites, and all whose spirits God has raised, prepare to go. Their neighbors provide them with vessels of silver and gold, goods, beasts, and other precious things. King Cyrus also brings out the vessels of the house of the Lord that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem. He has them counted out by the treasurer, Mithredath, to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. The inventory includes thousands of gold and silver vessels, which Sheshbazzar brings with the returning exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.

## Ezra 2

A detailed list records the children of the province who return from the Babylonian captivity. They come with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, and other leaders, each returning to his own city in Judah and Jerusalem. The chapter provides a census of the people of Israel, listing the numbers of men from various families, such as the children of Parosh, Shephatiah, Arah, and Pahath-moab. It also enumerates the men from different towns, including Bethlehem, Netophah, and Anathoth. Following the general population, the priests are numbered by their families: the children of Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur, and Harim. The Levites are also counted, along with the singers from the family of Asaph and the porters (gatekeepers) from the families of Shallum, Ater, and others.

The record also includes the Nethinims (temple servants) and the children of Solomon’s servants. A group of people who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer are noted because they cannot prove their lineage. Similarly, some of the priests—the children of Habaiah, Koz, and Barzillai—are excluded from the priesthood as polluted because they cannot find their genealogical records. The Tirshatha (governor) instructs them not to eat of the most holy things until a priest can consult the Urim and Thummim. The total number of the congregation is 42,360, besides 7,337 servants and 200 singing men and women. Their livestock includes horses, mules, camels, and asses. Upon arriving at the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, some of the chief fathers offer freely for the work, giving gold, silver, and priests’ garments. The priests, Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, and the rest of the people settle in their respective cities.

## Ezra 3

When the seventh month arrives, the children of Israel, now settled in their cities, gather together as one man in Jerusalem. Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his fellow priests, along with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren, build the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings as prescribed in the Law of Moses. They set the altar on its bases, for they are afraid of the people of the surrounding countries, and they offer morning and evening burnt offerings to the Lord. They also keep the Feast of Tabernacles as it is written, offering the required daily burnt offerings. Afterward, they establish the continual burnt offering, the offerings for the new moons, and for all the set feasts of the Lord, as well as freewill offerings. From the first day of the seventh month, they begin to offer burnt offerings, even though the foundation of the temple has not yet been laid.

They provide money to the masons and carpenters, and they give food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant from Cyrus king of Persia. In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of their brethren—the priests, the Levites, and all who have come out of captivity—begin the work. They appoint the Levites from twenty years old and upward to oversee the work of the house of the Lord. When the builders lay the foundation of the temple, the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, are set in place to praise the Lord according to the ordinance of King David of Israel. They sing together in courses, praising and giving thanks to the Lord, saying, “For he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.” All the people shout with a great shout of praise because the foundation of the house of the Lord is laid. However, many of the older priests, Levites, and chief fathers who had seen the first temple weep with a loud voice when they see the foundation of this house, while many others shout aloud for joy. The noise of the shout of joy cannot be discerned from the noise of the weeping, for the people shout with a loud shout, and the sound is heard far off.

## Ezra 4

When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin hear that the returned exiles are building the temple, they approach Zerubbabel and the chief fathers, offering to help. They claim to seek the same God and to have been sacrificing to Him since they were brought to the land by Esarhaddon, king of Assyria. Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the leaders of Israel refuse their offer, stating that they alone will build the house for the Lord God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded them. In response, the people of the land weaken the hands of the people of Judah and trouble them in their building efforts. They hire counselors to frustrate the project throughout the rest of the reign of Cyrus and until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.

During the reign of Ahasuerus, an accusation is written against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. Later, in the days of King Artaxerxes of Persia, officials named Bishlam, Mithredath, and Tabeel write a letter to the king. Following this, Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe, along with their companions from various nations settled in Samaria, also write a letter to King Artaxerxes. They inform the king that the Jews who came from him have arrived in Jerusalem and are rebuilding the “rebellious and the bad city,” setting up its walls and joining the foundations. They warn that if the city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, the Jews will no longer pay toll, tribute, and custom, which will damage the revenue of the kings. They urge the king to search the official records of his fathers, where he will find that Jerusalem has a history of rebellion and sedition. King Artaxerxes sends a reply, confirming that after a search, it is found that the city has a history of insurrection. He commands that the work be stopped until he gives a new commandment. Upon receiving the king’s letter, Rehum, Shimshai, and their companions go quickly to Jerusalem and force the Jews to cease their work. As a result, the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stops, and it remains halted until the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia.

## Ezra 5

The prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesy to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel. In response, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rise up and begin to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem, with the prophets of God helping them. At that time, Tatnai, the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, and Shethar-boznai and their companions come to them and ask who has commanded them to build the house and make up the wall. The Jewish elders provide the names of the men responsible for the construction. However, the eye of their God is upon the elders of the Jews, so their opponents cannot make them stop the work until the matter is brought before King Darius and a written reply is received.

Tatnai, Shethar-boznai, and their companions send a copy of a letter to King Darius. The letter reports that they went to the province of Judea and found the house of the great God being built with great stones and timber laid in the walls, and that the work is progressing rapidly and prospering. When questioned, the elders identify themselves as servants of the God of heaven and earth, rebuilding the temple that was originally built many years ago by a great king of Israel. They explain that their fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath, which led to their being given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who destroyed the temple and carried the people away. They state, however, that in the first year of his reign, King Cyrus of Babylon made a decree to rebuild the house of God. He returned the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had taken and delivered them to a governor named Sheshbazzar, commanding him to return them to the temple in Jerusalem and to rebuild the house of God in its place. Sheshbazzar then laid the foundation, and the work has been ongoing but is not yet finished. The letter concludes by requesting that a search be made in the king's treasure house in Babylon to determine if a decree was indeed made by King Cyrus to build the house of God at Jerusalem, and asks the king to send his decision on the matter.

## Ezra 6

King Darius makes a decree, and a search is conducted in the archives in Babylon. A scroll is found in the palace at Achmetha in the province of the Medes, containing a record of the decree made by King Cyrus in his first year. The decree states that the house of God at Jerusalem should be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices, with specific dimensions for its height and breadth. It also directs that the expenses be paid from the king's treasury and that the gold and silver vessels taken from the temple by Nebuchadnezzar be returned to their place in the house of God in Jerusalem. Consequently, King Darius issues a new decree to Tatnai, the governor, and his associates, commanding them to stay away from Jerusalem and to let the work on the house of God proceed. He orders that the expenses for the construction be paid in full from the royal revenue collected from the tribute of the region beyond the river, so that the work is not hindered. He also commands that provisions for burnt offerings—young bullocks, rams, and lambs—as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil, be given to the priests in Jerusalem daily, so they may offer sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. The decree includes a severe penalty for anyone who alters it: a timber is to be pulled from his house, and he is to be hanged on it, and his house is to be made a dunghill. Darius concludes the decree by invoking the God who has caused His name to dwell there to overthrow any king or people who might try to alter or destroy the house of God.

Tatnai, Shethar-boznai, and their companions promptly carry out King Darius’s orders. The elders of the Jews continue to build and prosper, encouraged by the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah. They finish building the temple according to the commandment of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. The house is completed on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. The children of Israel—the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles—dedicate the house of God with joy. They offer a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and a sin offering of twelve he-goats for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes. They also set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses. The returned exiles celebrate the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. The priests and Levites are all ceremonially pure. They kill the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves. The children of Israel who have returned from captivity, along with all who have separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to seek the Lord God of Israel, eat the Passover. They celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, because the Lord has made them joyful and has turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God.

## Ezra 7

After these events, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, a descendant of Aaron the chief priest, comes on the scene. Ezra is a ready scribe in the Law of Moses, and the king grants him everything he requests, because the hand of the Lord his God is upon him. In the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, Ezra goes up from Babylon to Jerusalem, accompanied by some of the children of Israel, including priests, Levites, singers, porters, and Nethinims. He begins his journey on the first day of the first month and arrives in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, guided by the good hand of his God. The text notes that Ezra has prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, to do it, and to teach its statutes and judgments in Israel.

The chapter includes a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gives to Ezra, the priest and scribe of the Law of the God of heaven. In the letter, Artaxerxes decrees that any of the people of Israel, priests, or Levites in his realm who are willing to go to Jerusalem may go with Ezra. The king and his seven counselors send Ezra to inquire about the situation in Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of God. He is to carry the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, as well as any silver and gold he can find in the province of Babylon, along with the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the house of God in Jerusalem. Ezra is instructed to use the money to buy animals for sacrifices and to use the remaining silver and gold as he and his brethren see fit, according to the will of their God. The king also commands Ezra to deliver the vessels for the service of the house of God and provides for any additional needs from the king’s treasure house. Artaxerxes issues a decree to all the treasurers in the region beyond the river to provide Ezra with whatever he requires, up to a specified limit of silver, wheat, wine, oil, and salt. He commands that whatever is required by the God of heaven be done diligently for His house, so that there will not be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons. The king also exempts all priests, Levites, and other ministers of the house of God from paying toll, tribute, or custom. Finally, he authorizes Ezra, according to the wisdom of his God, to appoint magistrates and judges to judge the people beyond the river who know the laws of God, and to teach those who do not. The decree states that anyone who does not obey the law of God and the law of the king will be judged speedily, whether by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment. The chapter concludes with Ezra blessing the Lord God for putting such a thing in the king’s heart and for extending mercy to him before the king and his counselors. Strengthened by the hand of the Lord his God upon him, Ezra gathers chief men from Israel to go up with him.

## Ezra 8

This chapter lists the chief men and their genealogies who went up with Ezra from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes. The list includes descendants of Phinehas, Ithamar, and David, as well as members of various other families, with the number of males from each group specified. Ezra gathers them at the river that runs to Ahava, where they camp for three days. Upon reviewing the people and the priests, he finds no Levites among them. He then sends for several chief men and men of understanding, giving them a commandment for Iddo, the chief at the place Casiphia, to bring ministers for the house of God. By the good hand of God upon them, they bring Sherebiah, a man of understanding from the sons of Mahli (a son of Levi), along with his sons and brethren, totaling eighteen men. They also bring Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the sons of Merari, with their brethren and sons, totaling twenty men. Additionally, two hundred and twenty Nethinims (temple servants), whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, are brought, all of them designated by name.

At the river of Ahava, Ezra proclaims a fast, so that they might humble themselves before God and seek from Him a right way for themselves, their little ones, and all their substance. Ezra is ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect them from enemies along the way, because he had told the king that the hand of their God is upon all who seek Him for good, but His power and wrath are against all who forsake Him. So they fast and plead with God, and He answers their prayer. Ezra separates twelve of the chief priests, along with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren, and entrusts to them the silver, gold, and vessels that the king, his counselors, his lords, and all Israel had offered for the house of God. He charges them to watch over these treasures until they can weigh them before the chief priests, Levites, and chief fathers of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord. The priests and Levites receive the silver, gold, and vessels to bring to the house of their God in Jerusalem. They depart from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month. The hand of their God is upon them, and He delivers them from the hand of the enemy and from those who lay in wait along the way. They arrive in Jerusalem and stay for three days. On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels are weighed in the house of God and handed over to Meremoth the priest and Eleazar, with two Levites, Jozabad and Noadiah, assisting. The returned exiles offer burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he-goats for a sin offering. They also deliver the king’s commissions to the king’s lieutenants and governors of the region, who then support the people and the house of God.

## Ezra 9

After these things are done, the princes approach Ezra and report that the people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the surrounding peoples—the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites—but have engaged in their abominations. They have taken daughters of these peoples as wives for themselves and for their sons, mingling the holy seed with the people of the lands. The report adds that the hand of the princes and rulers has been foremost in this trespass. When Ezra hears this, he tears his garment and his mantle, plucks the hair from his head and beard, and sits down, stunned. All who tremble at the words of the God of Israel because of the transgression of the returned exiles assemble around him, and he remains stunned until the evening sacrifice.

At the evening sacrifice, Ezra rises from his state of heaviness and, with his garment and mantle torn, falls on his knees, spreads his hands to the Lord his God, and prays. He says, “O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee.” He confesses that their iniquities have increased over their heads and their trespass has grown up to the heavens. He acknowledges that since the days of their fathers they have been in a great trespass, and for their iniquities they, their kings, and their priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to spoil, and to confusion of face. He recognizes that for a brief moment, grace has been shown from the Lord their God, leaving them a remnant to escape and giving them a secure place, a little reviving in their bondage. Though they are bondmen, God has not forsaken them but has extended mercy to them in the sight of the kings of Persia, allowing them to rebuild the house of God and repair its desolations. He asks what they can say after this, for they have forsaken the commandments given through the prophets, which warned against intermarrying with the people of the land. After all that has come upon them for their evil deeds, and seeing that God has punished them less than they deserve and has given them such deliverance, he questions how they could break the commandments again. He fears that God would be angry enough to consume them, leaving no remnant. He concludes by acknowledging God’s righteousness and their position as an escaped remnant, confessing that they stand before God in their trespasses and cannot stand before Him because of their sin.

## Ezra 10

As Ezra prays, confesses, weeps, and casts himself down before the house of God, a very great congregation of men, women, and children from Israel assembles, and the people weep bitterly. Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, speaks up, saying to Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.” He proposes that they make a covenant with God to put away all the foreign wives and their children, according to the counsel of Ezra and of those who tremble at the commandment of God, and to act according to the law. He encourages Ezra to arise and take action, promising that they will be with him. Ezra then makes the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear an oath to do according to this word, and they swear. After this, Ezra goes into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib, where he continues to mourn, eating no bread and drinking no water because of the transgression of the returned exiles.

A proclamation is made throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the returned exiles to gather in Jerusalem within three days. It is announced that anyone who does not come will have all his substance forfeited and will be separated from the congregation. All the men of Judah and Benjamin gather in Jerusalem within the three days, on the twentieth day of the ninth month. The people sit in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of the matter and the great rain. Ezra the priest stands up and tells them they have transgressed by taking foreign wives, increasing the trespass of Israel. He urges them to make confession to the Lord God of their fathers and to separate themselves from the peoples of the land and from their foreign wives. The entire congregation answers with a loud voice that they will do as he has said. They add, however, that the people are many, it is a time of heavy rain, and they cannot stand outside, and that this is not a task for one or two days, as many have transgressed. They suggest that their rulers stand for the whole congregation, and that all who have taken foreign wives in their cities come at appointed times, accompanied by the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce wrath of God is turned from them. Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah are appointed to oversee the matter, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite assisting them. The returned exiles agree to this plan. Ezra the priest and certain chief fathers are set apart to examine the matter, beginning on the first day of the tenth month and finishing by the first day of the first month. The chapter concludes with a list of the men who had taken foreign wives, including priests, Levites, singers, porters, and other men of Israel, some of whom had children by these wives.
