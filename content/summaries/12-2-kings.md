# 2 Kings

## 2 Kings 1: The Rebellion and Death of Ahaziah

Following the death of his father Ahab, King Ahaziah of Israel faces a rebellion from Moab. The chapter begins with Ahaziah suffering a severe injury after falling through a lattice in his palace in Samaria. Instead of seeking guidance from the God of Israel, he sends messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, about his chances of recovery. This act of idolatry prompts a swift response from God, who sends the prophet Elijah to intercept the king's messengers. Elijah confronts them with a powerful rebuke, questioning whether they seek a foreign deity because there is no God in Israel. He then delivers a divine judgment: Ahaziah will not recover from his injuries and will surely die.

Upon hearing this prophecy, Ahaziah attempts to assert his authority by dispatching three successive captains, each with fifty men, to capture Elijah. The first two captains and their men are consumed by fire from heaven after they arrogantly command the prophet to come down. The third captain, however, approaches with humility, pleading for his life and the lives of his men. Recognizing his respectful demeanor, the angel of the Lord instructs Elijah to go with him to the king without fear. Elijah personally delivers the message of judgment to Ahaziah, who then dies as the prophet had foretold. With Ahaziah having no son to succeed him, his brother Jehoram becomes the new king of Israel.

## 2 Kings 2: Elijah's Ascension and Elisha's Inauguration

This chapter marks the dramatic transition of prophetic leadership from Elijah to Elisha. The narrative follows the two prophets as they journey from Gilgal to Bethel, Jericho, and finally to the Jordan River. At each stage, Elijah tests Elisha's loyalty by asking him to stay behind, but Elisha steadfastly refuses to leave his master. Along the way, companies of prophets foretell Elijah's impending departure, which Elisha acknowledges. Upon reaching the Jordan, Elijah strikes the water with his mantle, miraculously parting the river and allowing them to cross on dry ground. Before his ascension, Elijah grants Elisha's request for a "double portion" of his spirit, conditional upon Elisha witnessing his departure.

Suddenly, a chariot and horses of fire appear, separating the two prophets, and Elijah is taken up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha, having witnessed this extraordinary event, picks up Elijah's fallen mantle, a symbol of his inherited authority. He immediately demonstrates his new power by striking the Jordan River with the mantle, and the waters part for him as they had for Elijah. Elisha's ministry begins with two notable miracles: he purifies the contaminated water of Jericho and, in a stark display of divine authority, curses a group of youths who mock him, resulting in two she-bears mauling forty-two of them. These events firmly establish Elisha as Elijah's successor, endowed with the power and spirit of his master.

## 2 Kings 3: The Campaign Against Moab

After the death of Ahab, Mesha, the king of Moab, rebels against Israel. In response, Jehoram, the king of Israel, forms an alliance with Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom to suppress the rebellion. The allied armies march through the wilderness of Edom, but after seven days, they find themselves without water for their troops and animals. In desperation, Jehoram laments that the Lord has led them to their doom. However, the righteous Jehoshaphat inquires if there is a prophet of the Lord they can consult. They are directed to Elisha, the successor of Elijah.

Elisha, initially scornful of the idolatrous Jehoram, agrees to prophesy only out of respect for Jehoshaphat. He calls for a minstrel, and as the musician plays, the hand of the Lord comes upon him. Elisha prophesies that God will miraculously provide water by filling the valley with ditches, and he also foretells a decisive victory over the Moabites. The next morning, water flows into the valley as promised. The Moabites, seeing the water glistening red in the sun, mistakenly believe the allied forces have turned on each other and are now vulnerable. As they advance to plunder the camp, the Israelite army ambushes and soundly defeats them. The chapter concludes with a grim and desperate act: the king of Moab sacrifices his eldest son on the city wall, which causes a great indignation to come upon Israel, and they withdraw from the battle and return to their own land.

## 2 Kings 4: Elisha's Miracles of Provision and Life

This chapter showcases a series of miracles performed by Elisha, highlighting his role as a conduit of God's compassion and power. The first miracle involves a destitute widow of a prophet whose sons are about to be taken into slavery to pay a debt. Elisha instructs her to collect empty jars from her neighbors and pour her single pot of oil into them. The oil miraculously multiplies, filling every jar. Elisha then tells her to sell the oil to pay her debts and live on the remaining money, demonstrating God's provision for the faithful.

The second and most extensive account concerns a Shunammite woman who provides hospitality for Elisha. In gratitude, Elisha prophesies that she will bear a son, which she does. Years later, the child dies suddenly. The woman, with great faith, travels to Elisha for help. After an initial unsuccessful attempt by his servant Gehazi, Elisha goes to the woman's house and, through prayer and a remarkable procedure, resurrects the child. The chapter also includes two other miracles: the purification of a deadly stew for the sons of the prophets and the feeding of a hundred men with only twenty loaves of barley, with food to spare, further cementing Elisha's status as a powerful man of God.

## 2 Kings 5: The Healing of Naaman and the Greed of Gehazi

This chapter recounts the powerful story of Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army, who is afflicted with leprosy. On the advice of a captive Israelite servant girl, Naaman seeks healing from the prophet Elisha in Samaria. Initially approaching the king of Israel with a letter from the king of Syria, his request causes distress and suspicion. However, Elisha intervenes and instructs Naaman to wash himself seven times in the Jordan River. Naaman, a man of high stature, is initially enraged by the simplicity and perceived disrespect of the command, expecting a more dramatic and personal healing ritual. Persuaded by his servants to obey the prophet's words, he dips himself in the Jordan, and his flesh is miraculously restored. This healing leads to Naaman's profound conversion, as he returns to Elisha declaring that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel and offering a gift, which Elisha refuses.

The narrative takes a dark turn with the actions of Elisha's servant, Gehazi. Displeased that his master accepted no payment from the wealthy Syrian commander, Gehazi greedily pursues Naaman and lies to obtain silver and garments for himself. When he returns, Elisha, knowing through the spirit what has transpired, confronts him about his deceit. As a severe consequence for his avarice and for misrepresenting the nature of God's grace, Elisha curses Gehazi. Naaman's leprosy departs from him and clings to Gehazi and his descendants, leaving him a leper as white as snow. The chapter thus contrasts the genuine faith of a foreigner with the corrupting greed of one of God's own servants.

## 2 Kings 6: Elisha's Miracles of Protection and the Siege of Samaria

This chapter continues to highlight Elisha's prophetic power through a series of remarkable events. It begins with a simple yet profound miracle: Elisha makes a borrowed axe head, which had fallen into the Jordan River, float to the surface. This act of kindness to one of the sons of the prophets sets the stage for more dramatic displays of divine intervention. The narrative then shifts to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Syria. Elisha repeatedly uses his prophetic insight to reveal the Syrian king's military plans to the king of Israel, saving him from ambushes on multiple occasions. Frustrated and suspecting a traitor in his midst, the Syrian king is informed that Elisha is the source of the intelligence leaks. In response, he dispatches a great army to Dothan to capture the prophet.

When Elisha's servant sees the Syrian army surrounding the city, he is terrified. Elisha calms him with the famous words, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them," and prays for the servant's eyes to be opened. The servant then sees the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire, a celestial army protecting the prophet. Elisha then prays for the Syrian army to be struck with blindness, and he leads them into the heart of Samaria. Once there, he prays for their sight to be restored. Instead of slaughtering the captured army, Elisha instructs the king of Israel to feed them and send them back to their master, a gesture of mercy that temporarily halts the Syrian raids. The chapter ends on a grim note, however, as Ben-hadad, king of Syria, later besieges Samaria, leading to a severe famine and horrific conditions, including cannibalism, which drive the king of Israel to despair and a vow to kill Elisha.

## 2 Kings 7: The Siege of Samaria Lifted

This chapter opens with Elisha delivering a bold prophecy in the midst of the devastating famine in Samaria: by the next day, food will be so plentiful that it will be sold at an incredibly low price. A skeptical royal official scoffs at the prophecy, and Elisha foretells that the official will see the abundance but not partake in it. The fulfillment of this prophecy begins with four lepers at the city gate who, facing certain death from starvation, decide to surrender to the Syrian army. Upon reaching the Syrian camp, they find it completely deserted. The Lord had caused the Syrians to hear the sound of a great army, leading them to believe that Israel had hired foreign mercenaries. In a panic, they fled, leaving behind their tents, horses, and all their provisions.

After feasting and gathering valuables, the lepers realize their duty to report the good news to the starving city. The king of Israel, initially suspecting a trap, sends out scouts to confirm the report. They find the road to the Jordan littered with garments and vessels discarded by the fleeing Syrians. The people of Samaria then rush out to plunder the abandoned camp, and just as Elisha had prophesied, the price of food plummets. In the ensuing chaos at the city gate, the unbelieving official who had doubted Elisha's prophecy is trampled to death by the crowd, thus fulfilling the second part of the prophet's prediction: he saw the miracle but did not live to enjoy it.

## 2 Kings 8: The Shunammite's Land Restored and the Rise of Hazael

This chapter opens with Elisha advising the Shunammite woman, whose son he had resurrected, to leave Israel for seven years to escape a prophesied famine. She follows his counsel and sojourns in the land of the Philistines. Upon her return, she appeals to the king of Israel to have her house and land restored. In a moment of divine providence, her appeal coincides with the king speaking to Gehazi, Elisha's servant, about the prophet's great deeds. As Gehazi recounts the story of Elisha raising the boy from the dead, the woman and her son appear. This timely arrival confirms Gehazi's account, and the king, moved by the story, orders that all her property and the income it generated during her absence be returned to her.

The narrative then shifts to Damascus, where Elisha has traveled. Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, is ill and sends his official, Hazael, to inquire of the prophet whether he will recover. Elisha gives a cryptic reply, telling Hazael to inform the king that he will recover, yet revealing to Hazael that the king will surely die. Elisha then weeps as he foresees the terrible atrocities Hazael will commit against Israel as the future king of Syria. The next day, Hazael returns to his master, smothers him with a wet cloth, and seizes the throne. The chapter concludes by chronicling the wicked reigns of Jehoram and his son Ahaziah, kings of Judah, who, through their alliance with the house of Ahab, lead Judah into idolatry and sin. The chapter ends with Ahaziah going to visit the wounded King Joram of Israel in Jezreel, setting the stage for the dramatic events of the next chapter.

## 2 Kings 9: The Anointing of Jehu and the Fall of Joram and Jezebel

This chapter marks a violent and pivotal turning point in the history of Israel, as Elisha sets in motion the divine judgment against the house of Ahab. The prophet dispatches one of the sons of the prophets to Ramoth-gilead to anoint Jehu, a commander of the Israelite army, as the new king. The young prophet carries out the secret anointing and delivers a divine commission to Jehu: he is to utterly destroy the dynasty of Ahab and avenge the blood of the Lord's prophets shed by Jezebel. Upon revealing his anointing to his fellow commanders, they immediately rally behind him, proclaiming him king with the sound of trumpets. Jehu, known for his furious driving, immediately sets off for Jezreel to confront King Joram of Israel, who is recovering from battle wounds, and King Ahaziah of Judah, who is visiting him.

What follows is a swift and brutal fulfillment of prophecy. Joram and Ahaziah ride out to meet Jehu, but their inquiries of peace are met with a sharp rebuke of Jezebel's idolatry. Realizing the treachery, Joram attempts to flee but is struck down by an arrow from Jehu's bow. His body is cast into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, precisely as Elijah had foretold. Ahaziah is also pursued, mortally wounded, and dies at Megiddo. The bloody purge culminates in Jezreel, where Jezebel, defiantly adorned, taunts Jehu from a window. At Jehu's command, her own eunuchs throw her down, and she is trampled by horses. When Jehu later sends men to bury her, they find that dogs have consumed her body, leaving only her skull, feet, and the palms of her hands, another graphic fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy.

## 2 Kings 10: Jehu's Purge of Ahab's House and Baal Worship

This chapter details the brutal and systematic consolidation of Jehu's power and his fulfillment of the divine mandate to destroy the house of Ahab. Jehu begins by sending a letter to the elders of Samaria, who are raising Ahab's seventy sons, challenging them to select a successor and fight for their master's house. Intimidated by Jehu's power, they instead pledge their allegiance to him. Jehu then commands them to kill all of Ahab's sons and send their heads to him in Jezreel. The elders comply, and Jehu displays the heads in two heaps at the city gate, publicly declaring the fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy against Ahab. He proceeds to execute all remaining members of Ahab's family, his officials, and his priests in Jezreel.

Jehu's bloody purge continues as he travels to Samaria. He encounters and slaughters forty-two relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. He then forges an alliance with the righteous Jehonadab, son of Rechab, inviting him to witness his zeal for the Lord. Upon arriving in Samaria, Jehu eradicates the last remnants of Ahab's family there. In a cunning and ruthless move, he then feigns devotion to Baal, proclaiming a great festival to gather all the prophets, priests, and worshipers of Baal from throughout Israel. Once they are all assembled in the temple of Baal, Jehu has them trapped and massacred, and he demolishes the temple and its sacred pillars, effectively wiping out Baal worship from Israel. The chapter concludes with a mixed verdict on Jehu's reign. While the Lord commends him for his zeal in destroying Ahab's dynasty and promises his own descendants the throne for four generations, Jehu himself fails to turn from the idolatrous sins of Jeroboam. As a consequence, Israel begins to suffer military losses at the hands of Hazael of Syria.

## 2 Kings 11: The Usurpation of Athaliah and the Coronation of Joash

This chapter shifts the focus to the southern kingdom of Judah and details a period of intense political and religious turmoil. Following the death of her son, King Ahaziah, the ruthless Athaliah—daughter of Ahab and Jezebel—seizes power by systematically murdering all the royal heirs. However, her murderous plot is thwarted by Jehosheba, the sister of Ahaziah and wife of the high priest Jehoiada. Jehosheba manages to rescue the infant Joash, Ahaziah's son, and hides him and his nurse in the temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah reigns over the land. This act of bravery preserves the Davidic line from extinction.

In the seventh year, the high priest Jehoiada orchestrates a carefully planned coup to restore the rightful king to the throne. He secretly gathers the commanders of the guard, reveals the existence of the young king Joash, and makes a covenant with them. On the Sabbath, the guards are strategically positioned around the temple to protect the king. Jehoiada then brings out the seven-year-old Joash, crowns him, and anoints him as king, to the great joy and celebration of the people. When Athaliah hears the commotion and sees the newly crowned king, she cries, "Treason, Treason!" but her reign is over. By Jehoiada's command, she is escorted out of the temple and executed. Jehoiada then leads the nation in renewing their covenant with the Lord, which is followed by the destruction of the temple of Baal and the killing of its priest, Mattan. The chapter concludes with the young King Joash securely seated on the throne and the city of Jerusalem at peace.

## 2 Kings 12: The Reign of Joash and the Repair of the Temple

This chapter details the long reign of Joash (also called Jehoash) in Judah, which begins with great promise under the guidance of the high priest Jehoiada. For as long as Jehoiada lives and instructs him, Joash does what is right in the sight of the Lord, although he does not remove the high places where the people continue to offer sacrifices. A major focus of his reign is the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem, which had fallen into disrepair. Frustrated by the priests' slow progress in making the necessary repairs, Joash institutes a new system for collecting and managing the funds. A chest with a hole in the lid is placed at the entrance of the temple, and all the money brought by the people is deposited into it. This system proves effective, and the funds are faithfully used to hire craftsmen and purchase materials to fully repair the house of the Lord.

Despite this early piety, the latter part of Joash's reign is marked by compromise and a tragic end. When Hazael, the king of Syria, captures the Philistine city of Gath and sets his sights on Jerusalem, Joash takes all the sacred treasures from the temple and the king's palace and sends them to Hazael as a bribe to prevent an attack. This act of stripping the temple he had so carefully restored demonstrates a decline in his faith. The chapter concludes with a conspiracy among his own officials, who assassinate him in the house of Millo. Joash is buried in the city of David, and his son Amaziah succeeds him as king.

## 2 Kings 13: The Reigns of Jehoahaz and Joash in Israel, and the Death of Elisha

This chapter returns to the northern kingdom of Israel, chronicling the reigns of Jehoahaz and his son Joash, both of whom continue in the idolatrous sins of Jeroboam. Under Jehoahaz, Israel is severely oppressed by Hazael, king of Syria, and the nation's military is decimated. In his distress, Jehoahaz seeks the Lord, and in His compassion, God provides a savior to deliver Israel from Syrian domination, allowing them a period of respite. However, the people do not turn from their idolatry. Jehoahaz is succeeded by his son Joash, who also does evil in the sight of the Lord. The chapter then poignantly recounts the final days of the prophet Elisha.

As Elisha lies on his deathbed, King Joash of Israel visits him, weeping and acknowledging the prophet's vital role as the true defense of Israel. In a final prophetic act, Elisha instructs Joash to shoot an arrow eastward, declaring it the "arrow of the Lord's deliverance" from Syria. He then tells the king to strike the ground with the remaining arrows. Joash strikes the ground three times and stops, which angers the dying prophet. Elisha reveals that this action signifies that Israel will only defeat the Syrians three times, whereas if he had struck five or six times, he would have completely destroyed them. The chapter concludes with the death and burial of Elisha, followed by a remarkable post-mortem miracle: a dead man, hastily thrown into Elisha's tomb, is resurrected upon touching the prophet's bones. The chapter ends with Joash's three victories over Ben-hadad, the son of Hazael, in which he recaptures the cities of Israel, just as Elisha had prophesied.

## 2 Kings 14: The Reigns of Amaziah of Judah and Jeroboam II of Israel

This chapter presents the parallel reigns of Amaziah in Judah and Jeroboam II in Israel. Amaziah begins his reign righteously, executing the officials who assassinated his father, King Joash, yet adhering to the law of Moses by sparing their children. He achieves a significant military victory over Edom, but this success fills him with pride. He then foolishly challenges Jehoash, king of Israel, to battle. Jehoash responds with a cautionary fable, comparing the arrogant Amaziah to a thistle and himself to a cedar of Lebanon, but Amaziah refuses to listen. In the ensuing battle, Judah is soundly defeated, and Amaziah is captured. Jehoash proceeds to Jerusalem, where he breaks down a section of the city wall, plunders the temple and the royal treasury, and takes hostages before returning to Samaria. Amaziah outlives Jehoash by fifteen years but is eventually assassinated in a conspiracy, and his son Azariah (also known as Uzziah) is made king in his place.

The chapter then shifts to the northern kingdom, detailing the long and prosperous reign of Jeroboam II, the son of Joash. Although he continues in the idolatrous practices of his namesake, Jeroboam I, his reign is marked by significant military success. He restores the borders of Israel to their former glory, from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, fulfilling a prophecy by the prophet Jonah, son of Amittai. The text notes that the Lord saw the bitter affliction of Israel and, in His mercy, used Jeroboam II to save them, as He had not yet determined to blot out their name from under heaven. The chapter concludes with the death of Jeroboam II and the accession of his son Zachariah to the throne of Israel.

## 2 Kings 15: A Period of Royal Instability and Decline

This chapter chronicles a tumultuous and bloody period in the history of both Israel and Judah, marked by a rapid succession of kings, conspiracies, and assassinations, particularly in the northern kingdom. The chapter begins with the long and generally prosperous reign of Azariah (also known as Uzziah) in Judah, who reigned for 52 years. He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, yet like his predecessors, he failed to remove the high places. As a consequence, the Lord afflicted him with leprosy, and his son Jotham governed as regent until his death. In stark contrast, the northern kingdom of Israel descends into chaos. The dynasty of Jehu ends with the assassination of his great-grandson Zachariah, who reigns for only six months. His killer, Shallum, holds the throne for a mere month before he is, in turn, assassinated by Menahem.

Menahem's brutal ten-year reign is notable for the first major intervention by the rising power of Assyria. To secure his throne, Menahem pays a heavy tribute to King Pul (Tiglath-Pileser III) of Assyria, which he exacts from the wealthy men of Israel. This act sets a dangerous precedent of dependency on a foreign power. Menahem is succeeded by his son Pekahiah, who reigns for two years before being murdered by his own captain, Pekah. Pekah's twenty-year reign sees further encroachment by Assyria, with Tiglath-Pileser capturing significant territory in northern Israel and deporting its inhabitants. Pekah himself is eventually assassinated by Hoshea. The chapter concludes by noting the righteous reign of Jotham in Judah, who succeeded his father Azariah, and the beginning of the Syro-Ephraimite war, as the Lord begins to send King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah of Israel against Judah.

## 2 Kings 16: The Wicked Reign of Ahaz in Judah

This chapter details the disastrous reign of King Ahaz of Judah, who is presented as one of the most wicked kings in the Davidic line. Unlike his ancestor David, Ahaz walks in the ways of the kings of Israel, engaging in widespread idolatry and even sacrificing his own son in the fire, following the detestable practices of the surrounding nations. His reign is marked by a severe political crisis as Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, form an alliance and besiege Jerusalem in an attempt to depose him. Although they are unable to conquer the city, they inflict significant damage and reclaim the port of Elath for Syria.

In a desperate and faithless move, Ahaz ignores the counsel of the prophet Isaiah (as detailed in the book of Isaiah) and instead seeks help from Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria. Declaring himself a servant and son to the Assyrian king, Ahaz plunders the treasures of the temple and the royal palace to pay for this alliance. Assyria responds by attacking and capturing Damascus, killing King Rezin, and deporting its people, thus relieving the immediate pressure on Judah. However, this alliance comes at a great spiritual cost. While in Damascus, Ahaz is impressed by a pagan altar and sends a model of it to the priest Urijah in Jerusalem, commanding him to build a replica. Upon his return, Ahaz replaces the bronze altar of the Lord with this new, foreign altar and makes further alterations to the temple, desecrating it to please the king of Assyria. The chapter concludes with the death of Ahaz and the accession of his son, Hezekiah, setting the stage for a dramatic reversal of policy.

## 2 Kings 17: The Fall of Israel and the Origin of the Samaritans

This pivotal chapter records the tragic end of the northern kingdom of Israel. It begins with the reign of Hoshea, the last king of Israel, who, after conspiring against the king of Assyria by seeking an alliance with Egypt, is captured and imprisoned. This rebellion prompts the Assyrian king Shalmaneser to besiege Samaria, the capital of Israel. After a three-year siege, the city falls, and the Israelites are deported and scattered throughout the Assyrian empire. The chapter then provides a lengthy theological explanation for this national catastrophe, attributing it directly to the persistent sin and idolatry of the people. It recounts how Israel, from the time of their division from Judah under Jeroboam, had consistently disobeyed the Lord, ignoring the warnings of the prophets and adopting the pagan practices of the surrounding nations, including the worship of Baal and the two golden calves.

The second part of the chapter describes the repopulation of the land of Israel with foreign peoples from various parts of the Assyrian empire. These new inhabitants, unfamiliar with the God of Israel, are plagued by lions, which they interpret as a sign of divine anger. In response, the king of Assyria sends back one of the exiled Israelite priests to teach the new settlers how to worship the Lord. This results in a syncretic religion where the people both fear the Lord and continue to worship their own idols. This mixed population and their blended religious practices give rise to the people who would later be known as the Samaritans, a group viewed with suspicion and hostility by the Jews who would eventually return to Judah from the Babylonian exile.

## 2 Kings 18: The Righteous Reign of Hezekiah and the Assyrian Threat

This chapter introduces one of Judah's most righteous kings, Hezekiah, who stands in stark contrast to his wicked father, Ahaz. Hezekiah begins his reign with a sweeping religious reformation, removing the high places, destroying the sacred pillars and Asherah poles, and even breaking into pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, as it had become an object of idolatry. The text commends him for trusting in the Lord completely, so that there was no king like him in Judah, before or after. As a result of his faithfulness, the Lord is with him, and he prospers in all his endeavors, including a successful rebellion against the king of Assyria and military victories over the Philistines. The chapter also recaps the fall of Samaria, which occurred in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, reiterating that Israel's exile was a direct consequence of their disobedience to God.

Despite Hezekiah's initial success, the formidable Assyrian empire under King Sennacherib eventually turns its attention to Judah, conquering all of its fortified cities. In a moment of weakness, Hezekiah attempts to appease Sennacherib by paying a heavy tribute, stripping the temple and the royal palace of their silver and gold. This appeasement fails, and Sennacherib sends a large army to besiege Jerusalem. The Assyrian commander, the Rabshakeh, delivers a series of intimidating and blasphemous speeches to Hezekiah's officials and the people of Jerusalem. He mocks their trust in Egypt and, most significantly, their trust in the Lord, claiming that no god has ever been able to deliver a nation from the hand of the king of Assyria. The chapter ends with Hezekiah's officials returning to him with their clothes torn, reporting the Rabshakeh's insolent words and setting the stage for a major confrontation between the power of Assyria and the God of Israel.

## 2 Kings 19: Hezekiah's Prayer and God's Deliverance

This chapter continues the narrative of the Assyrian crisis, detailing Hezekiah's response to the blasphemous threats of Sennacherib. Upon hearing the report from his officials, a distraught Hezekiah tears his clothes, covers himself in sackcloth, and goes to the temple to pray. He also sends a delegation to the prophet Isaiah, seeking a word from the Lord. Isaiah sends back a message of reassurance, prophesying that Sennacherib will be turned back by a rumor and will ultimately fall by the sword in his own land. Undeterred, Sennacherib sends another threatening letter to Hezekiah, boasting of his invincibility and mocking Hezekiah's trust in God. In a powerful act of faith, Hezekiah takes the letter, spreads it out before the Lord in the temple, and prays earnestly for deliverance, not for his own sake, but so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that the Lord alone is God.

In response to Hezekiah's prayer, the Lord sends a powerful message through the prophet Isaiah. The prophecy taunts Sennacherib for his arrogance and blasphemy against the Holy One of Israel, declaring that the Assyrian king is merely a tool in God's sovereign plan. The Lord promises to defend Jerusalem for His own name's sake and for the sake of His servant David. The climax of the chapter is a dramatic and miraculous act of divine intervention: that very night, the angel of the Lord passes through the Assyrian camp and strikes down 185,000 soldiers. The next morning, the once-mighty army is a field of corpses. Sennacherib is forced to withdraw in disgrace and return to Nineveh. The chapter concludes with the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy as Sennacherib is assassinated by his own sons while worshiping his god, Nisroch.

## 2 Kings 20: Hezekiah's Sickness, Recovery, and Folly

This chapter recounts two significant events in the latter part of Hezekiah's reign. First, Hezekiah becomes mortally ill, and the prophet Isaiah delivers a message from the Lord that he should prepare for death. In deep distress, Hezekiah turns his face to the wall and prays fervently, reminding God of his faithful and wholehearted service. Moved by his prayer and tears, the Lord sends Isaiah back to the king with a new message: Hezekiah will be healed, and fifteen years will be added to his life. As a sign of this promise, the Lord miraculously causes the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz to move backward ten degrees. This event underscores God's power over life and death and His responsiveness to heartfelt prayer.

Following his recovery, Hezekiah receives envoys from the king of Babylon, who have come to congratulate him. In a display of pride and poor judgment, Hezekiah shows the Babylonian delegation all the treasures of his palace and kingdom. This act of folly prompts a stern rebuke from the prophet Isaiah, who delivers a sobering prophecy: the day will come when everything Hezekiah has displayed, along with his own descendants, will be carried off to Babylon. This is the first explicit prophecy of the Babylonian exile. Hezekiah's response is one of passive acceptance, expressing relief that there will be peace and security in his own lifetime. The chapter concludes by mentioning Hezekiah's other achievements, most notably the construction of the Siloam Tunnel to bring water into Jerusalem, and records his death and the succession of his son, Manasseh.

## 2 Kings 21: The Abominable Reigns of Manasseh and Amon

This chapter marks a tragic and drastic reversal of the religious reforms instituted by Hezekiah. His son, Manasseh, ascends to the throne and embarks on a 55-year reign of unparalleled wickedness, systematically undoing all the good his father had accomplished. He rebuilds the high places, erects altars for Baal, and places an Asherah pole in the temple itself, the very place where God had chosen to put His name. Manasseh's apostasy is extreme; he practices child sacrifice, engages in sorcery and divination, and consults mediums and spiritists, provoking the Lord to anger more than any of the nations the Israelites had dispossessed. His actions lead the entire nation of Judah astray.

As a direct result of Manasseh's profound and unrepentant sin, the Lord pronounces a severe and irreversible judgment upon Jerusalem and Judah. Through his prophets, God declares that He will bring such a disaster upon them that the ears of all who hear of it will tingle. He promises to wipe Jerusalem clean, just as one wipes a dish, and to forsake the remnant of His inheritance, delivering them into the hands of their enemies. The chapter also notes that Manasseh shed a great deal of innocent blood, filling Jerusalem from one end to another. After his death, his son Amon continues his father's evil ways for two years before being assassinated by his own officials. The people of the land, however, execute the conspirators and place Amon's eight-year-old son, Josiah, on the throne, setting the stage for the final, dramatic chapter in the history of the kingdom of Judah.

## 2 Kings 22: The Good King Josiah and the Discovery of the Law

This chapter introduces the reign of Josiah, who stands as a beacon of righteousness in the final decades of the kingdom of Judah. Ascending to the throne at the tender age of eight, Josiah does what is right in the sight of the Lord, walking in the ways of his ancestor David without deviation. In the eighteenth year of his reign, he initiates a project to repair the temple in Jerusalem, which had been neglected and desecrated by his predecessors. He entrusts the funds for this project to the workmen, who deal so faithfully that no accounting is required of them. It is during these repairs that a pivotal discovery is made: Hilkiah the high priest finds "the book of the law" in the house of the Lord, a text that had been lost and forgotten for generations.

When the book is brought and read to King Josiah, his reaction is profound and immediate. Upon hearing the words of the law and the curses prescribed for disobedience, he tears his clothes in a sign of deep grief and repentance. Realizing the extent to which the nation has strayed from God's commandments, he sends a delegation to inquire of the Lord through the prophetess Huldah. She confirms that the Lord's wrath is indeed kindled against Judah and that the judgments written in the book will surely come to pass because of the people's persistent idolatry. However, she also delivers a personal message of grace to Josiah. Because his heart was tender and he humbled himself before the Lord, God promises to gather him to his grave in peace, and he will not see the disaster that is to befall Jerusalem. This discovery and prophecy set the stage for the most extensive religious reformation in Judah's history.

## 2 Kings 23: Josiah's Reforms and Tragic Death

This chapter details the sweeping and vigorous religious reforms undertaken by King Josiah in response to the discovery of the Book of the Law. Josiah gathers all the people of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple and, after reading the book to them, leads them in renewing their covenant with the Lord, promising to follow His commandments with all their heart and soul. What follows is the most thorough purification of worship in Judah's history. Josiah systematically purges the land of all forms of idolatry, removing pagan vessels from the temple, deposing idolatrous priests, and tearing down high places, altars, and sacred poles throughout his kingdom. His reforms extend even to Bethel, where he defiles the altar built by Jeroboam, thus fulfilling a prophecy made centuries earlier. The chapter culminates in the celebration of a Passover feast so magnificent that none like it had been held since the days of the judges.

Despite the unparalleled scope and sincerity of Josiah's reforms, the chapter delivers a somber and pivotal message: the Lord's fierce anger against Judah, kindled by the egregious sins of Manasseh, was not turned away. The divine decree of exile remained in effect. The chapter then takes a tragic turn, recounting the premature death of the righteous King Josiah. He goes out to confront Pharaoh Necho of Egypt, who is marching north to aid the Assyrians, and is killed in battle at Megiddo. His death is a great blow to the nation and marks the beginning of the end for the kingdom of Judah. The people anoint his son Jehoahaz as king, but his reign is short-lived. After only three months, Pharaoh Necho deposes him, takes him captive to Egypt, and imposes a heavy tribute on Judah. Necho then installs Jehoahaz's brother, Eliakim, as a puppet king, changing his name to Jehoiakim, who proceeds to do evil in the sight of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 24: The Beginning of the End for Judah

This chapter marks the beginning of the final, tragic downfall of the kingdom of Judah. During the reign of the evil King Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar, the powerful king of Babylon, invades and makes Judah a vassal state. After three years, Jehoiakim rebels, a decision that proves disastrous. The Lord, in fulfillment of His prophetic word, sends bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites to ravage the land. The text explicitly states that this judgment comes upon Judah because of the cumulative sins of Manasseh, particularly the shedding of innocent blood, which the Lord would not pardon. After Jehoiakim's death, his son Jehoiachin ascends the throne, but his reign is a mere three months of continued evil before Nebuchadnezzar's forces besiege Jerusalem.

In the face of overwhelming odds, King Jehoiachin surrenders to Nebuchadnezzar. This leads to the first major deportation of the people of Judah to Babylon in 597 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar carries away the king, his family, his officials, and all the leading men of valor, craftsmen, and smiths—ten thousand captives in all. He also plunders the temple and the royal palace, taking all the treasures and cutting into pieces the golden vessels made by Solomon, just as the Lord had foretold. Only the poorest people of the land are left behind. Nebuchadnezzar then installs Jehoiachin's uncle, Mattaniah, as king, changing his name to Zedekiah. However, Zedekiah also does evil in the sight of the Lord, and his eventual rebellion against Babylon will set the stage for the final and complete destruction of Jerusalem.

## 2 Kings 25: The Fall of Jerusalem and the Babylonian Exile

This final chapter of 2 Kings provides a grim and detailed account of the destruction of Jerusalem and the culmination of the Babylonian exile. Following King Zedekiah's rebellion, Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army besiege Jerusalem for nearly two years, leading to a severe famine in the city. Eventually, the city walls are breached, and Zedekiah and his army attempt to flee but are captured in the plains of Jericho. In a brutal act of retribution, Nebuchadnezzar forces Zedekiah to watch the execution of his sons before his own eyes are put out. Blinded and bound in bronze shackles, the last king of Judah is taken captive to Babylon. Shortly thereafter, Nebuzaradan, the captain of Nebuchadnezzar's guard, arrives in Jerusalem and systematically destroys the city. He burns down the temple of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the great houses, and his army demolishes the city walls. The remaining people are carried off into exile, leaving only the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.

The Babylonians strip the temple of all its remaining treasures, breaking up the large bronze pillars and the bronze sea that Solomon had made and carrying the metal away. The chief priests and other leading officials are taken to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah and executed, completing the subjugation of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar appoints a man named Gedaliah to govern the remnant left in the land, but this brief period of stability is shattered when Gedaliah is assassinated by a member of the royal family. Fearing Babylonian reprisals, the remaining population flees to Egypt. The book of 2 Kings concludes on a small but significant note of hope. Many years later, Evil-merodach, the new king of Babylon, releases the captive King Jehoiachin from prison, treats him with kindness, and gives him a place of honor at his table for the rest of his life. This final act provides a glimmer of hope that God has not entirely abandoned His people or the line of David, foreshadowing a future restoration.
