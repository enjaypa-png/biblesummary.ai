# 2 Kings Summary (KJV)

## 2 Kings 1: Elijah’s Final Prophecy

The book of 2 Kings opens with the reign of Ahaziah, Ahab’s son and successor, who continues his father’s wicked ways. After falling through a lattice in his upper chamber, Ahaziah is seriously injured. Instead of inquiring of the Lord of Israel, he sends messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether he will recover. The prophet Elijah is sent by an angel to intercept the messengers. He confronts them with the question, “Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?” and delivers a message of judgment: Ahaziah will not recover but will surely die.

When the messengers return and describe the man who met them, Ahaziah immediately identifies him as Elijah the Tishbite. The king then sends a captain with fifty men to arrest the prophet. The captain finds Elijah sitting on a hill and arrogantly commands him, “Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.” Elijah replies, “If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.” Fire comes down and consumes them. The king sends a second captain and his fifty men, who meet the same fiery end. The third captain, however, approaches Elijah with humility, falls on his knees, and begs for his life and the lives of his men to be spared. The angel of the Lord then tells Elijah to go with this man and not be afraid. Elijah goes to the king and delivers the prophecy of death to his face. Ahaziah dies according to the Lord’s word, and because he has no son, his brother Jehoram succeeds him as king of Israel.

## 2 Kings 2: Elijah’s Ascension and Elisha’s Succession

This chapter records the dramatic transition of prophetic leadership from Elijah to his disciple, Elisha. The time comes for the Lord to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. As they travel together, Elijah repeatedly tries to get Elisha to stay behind, but Elisha refuses, vowing three times, “As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.” At the Jordan River, Elijah takes his mantle, rolls it up, and strikes the water. The water parts, and the two men cross over on dry ground.

Once across, Elijah asks Elisha what he can do for him before he is taken. Elisha asks for a “double portion” of Elijah’s spirit—a request not for twice the power, but for the inheritance of the firstborn son, to be recognized as the legitimate successor. Elijah tells him it is a hard thing he has asked, but it will be granted if he sees him when he is taken. As they are walking and talking, a chariot of fire with horses of fire appears and separates them, and Elijah is taken up into heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha sees it and cries out, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof!” He then picks up Elijah’s mantle, which has fallen from him, and returns to the Jordan. He strikes the water with the mantle, asking, “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” The water parts again, and Elisha crosses over. The company of prophets who had been watching from a distance recognizes that the spirit of Elijah now rests on Elisha. Elisha then performs his first miracles, healing the contaminated water of Jericho and calling down a curse on a group of youths who mock him, resulting in two bears mauling forty-two of them.

## 2 Kings 3: The Campaign Against Moab

Jehoram, son of Ahab, is now king of Israel. He is evil, but not as evil as his parents, for he does remove the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made. After the death of Ahab, the king of Moab, a vassal state, had rebelled against Israel. Jehoram decides to launch a military campaign to reassert Israelite control. He enlists the help of Jehoshaphat, the righteous king of Judah, who agrees to join him. The two kings, along with the king of Edom, march their armies through the desert of Edom.

After seven days, the armies and their animals are on the verge of dying from thirst, as there is no water. The desperate Jehoram cries out that the Lord has brought them there to be destroyed. Jehoshaphat, however, asks if there is a prophet of the Lord they can inquire of. They are told about Elisha, and the three kings go to him. Elisha initially scoffs at Jehoram, telling him to go to the prophets of his father and mother. But for the sake of Jehoshaphat, he agrees to help. He calls for a musician, and as the musician plays, the hand of the Lord comes upon Elisha. He prophesies that the Lord will fill the valley with pools of water, even though they will see no wind or rain. He also predicts a decisive victory over Moab. The next morning, water comes from the direction of Edom and fills the land. The Moabites, seeing the water shimmering red in the morning sun, think the allied armies have fought and killed each other. They rush in to plunder the camp, only to be met by the Israelite army, which routes them and devastates their land.

## 2 Kings 4: Elisha’s Miracles: The Widow’s Oil and the Shunammite’s Son

This chapter recounts several of Elisha’s miracles, demonstrating God’s power working through him to provide for the needy and to overcome death. First, the widow of a man from the company of the prophets cries out to Elisha for help. A creditor has come to take her two sons as slaves to pay off a debt. Elisha asks what she has in her house, and she replies, “Nothing at all, except a small jar of olive oil.” He tells her to go and borrow as many empty jars as she can from her neighbors. She is to go inside, shut the door, and pour her oil into the jars. She does so, and the oil miraculously keeps flowing until every jar is full. Elisha then tells her to go, sell the oil, pay her debts, and live on the rest.

Next, Elisha frequently passes through the town of Shunem, where a wealthy woman has built a room for him to stay in. In gratitude, Elisha offers to do something for her. She is content, but Elisha’s servant, Gehazi, points out that she has no son and her husband is old. Elisha prophesies that she will have a son, and a year later, she gives birth. Some years later, the boy is in the field with his father when he suddenly complains of a pain in his head, and he dies. The Shunammite woman lays the boy on Elisha’s bed and, without telling her husband the boy is dead, rides off to find the prophet at Mount Carmel. When she tells Elisha what has happened, he sends Gehazi ahead with his staff, but the boy does not revive. Elisha himself then goes to the house, goes into the room with the boy, and prays to the Lord. He lies on top of the child, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands, and the boy’s body grows warm. The boy sneezes seven times and opens his eyes. Elisha then presents the living child to his grateful mother. The chapter concludes with two more miracles: Elisha purifies a pot of poisonous stew and multiplies twenty loaves of barley bread to feed a hundred men.

## 2 Kings 5: The Healing of Naaman

Naaman is the commander of the army of the king of Aram (Syria). He is a great and valiant soldier, but he suffers from leprosy. In his household is a young Israelite girl who had been captured in a raid, and she tells her mistress about the prophet in Samaria who could heal him. The king of Aram sends Naaman to the king of Israel with a letter and lavish gifts, asking him to heal his commander. The king of Israel is distraught, thinking the king of Aram is trying to pick a fight with him. When Elisha hears of the king’s distress, he sends a message, telling him to send Naaman to him, “and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”

Naaman arrives at Elisha’s house with his horses and chariots. Elisha does not even come out to meet him but sends a messenger to tell him to go and wash himself seven times in the Jordan River, and he will be cleansed. Naaman is furious at this perceived slight. He had expected the prophet to come out, call on the name of the Lord, and wave his hand over the spot to heal him. He complains that the rivers of his own city, Damascus, are better than all the waters of Israel. His servants, however, gently persuade him to obey the prophet’s simple command. Naaman goes down to the Jordan, dips himself seven times, and his flesh is restored, becoming clean like that of a young boy. He returns to Elisha, a changed man, and declares, “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel.” He offers Elisha a gift, but the prophet refuses to accept any payment. Naaman then asks for some of Israel’s soil to take back with him, so he can build an altar and worship the Lord. However, Elisha’s servant, Gehazi, greedily runs after Naaman and, in Elisha’s name, lies to get some of the treasure. When he returns, Elisha confronts him, and as a punishment, Naaman’s leprosy clings to Gehazi and his descendants forever.

## 2 Kings 6: Elisha’s Miracles and the Aramean War

This chapter continues to recount the miraculous ministry of Elisha. First, while the company of the prophets is building a new meeting place by the Jordan River, a borrowed axe head flies off its handle and falls into the water. The man who lost it is distressed because it was borrowed. Elisha cuts a stick, throws it into the water at the spot where the axe head fell, and the iron axe head miraculously floats to the surface.

The narrative then shifts back to the conflict with Aram. The king of Aram is at war with Israel, but every time he plans a secret attack, Elisha, through divine revelation, warns the king of Israel, who is then able to avoid the trap. The king of Aram is furious, thinking he has a traitor in his midst. When he learns that it is Elisha who is revealing his plans, he sends a large force of horses and chariots to the city of Dothan to capture him. In the morning, Elisha’s servant sees the Aramean army surrounding the city and is terrified. Elisha reassures him, saying, “Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.” He then prays that the servant’s eyes may be opened, and the servant sees the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. As the Arameans move in, Elisha prays that they will be struck with blindness, and the Lord answers. Elisha then leads the blind army into Samaria, the capital of Israel. Once there, he prays that their sight will be restored. The king of Israel wants to kill them, but Elisha tells him to feed them and send them back to their master. This act of mercy causes the Aramean raiders to cease their attacks—for a time.

## 2 Kings 7: The Siege of Samaria Lifted

Sometime later, Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, besieges Samaria again, and the resulting famine is so severe that the people resort to cannibalism. The king of Israel, in despair, blames Elisha and vows to kill him. Elisha, however, prophesies that by this time tomorrow, there will be an abundance of food in the city, with flour and barley being sold at a cheap price. A royal officer scoffs at this, saying it would be impossible even if the Lord opened the windows of heaven. Elisha replies that the officer will see it with his own eyes but will not eat any of it.

That evening, four lepers sitting at the city gate decide they have nothing to lose and go to the Aramean camp to surrender. When they arrive, they find the camp completely deserted. The Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the sound of a great army, with chariots and horses, and they had fled in panic, thinking the king of Israel had hired foreign armies to attack them. They left everything behind—their tents, horses, donkeys, and food. The lepers eat their fill and gather silver, gold, and clothes. They then realize they must share the good news. They return to the city and tell the gatekeepers. The king is initially suspicious, thinking it is a trap, but when his scouts confirm the report, the starving people of the city rush out and plunder the Aramean camp. The price of food plummets, just as Elisha had prophesied. The skeptical royal officer is put in charge of the gate, and he is trampled to death by the crowd, fulfilling the second part of Elisha’s prophecy.

## 2 Kings 8: The Shunammite’s Land and the Rise of Hazael

This chapter ties up a loose end from the story of the Shunammite woman and then describes a significant political change in the kingdom of Aram. Elisha had warned the Shunammite woman, whose son he had restored to life, to leave the land because a seven-year famine was coming. She and her household go and live in the land of the Philistines for seven years. When the famine is over, she returns and goes to the king to appeal for her house and her land to be restored to her. As it happens, she arrives just as the king is talking with Gehazi, Elisha’s servant, and asking him to tell him about the great things Elisha has done. Gehazi is in the middle of telling the king how Elisha had restored a dead boy to life when the woman herself appears. Gehazi confirms, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.” The king is amazed, appoints an official to her case, and orders that all her property and all the income from her land from the day she left be restored to her.

Elisha then travels to Damascus, the capital of Aram. King Ben-Hadad is ill, and when he hears the man of God is there, he sends his official, Hazael, with a lavish gift to inquire of the prophet whether he will recover. Elisha tells Hazael to go and tell the king that he will recover, but he also tells Hazael that the Lord has shown him that the king will in fact die. Elisha then stares at Hazael until he becomes uncomfortable, and the prophet begins to weep. When Hazael asks why, Elisha describes the terrible atrocities that he knows Hazael will commit against the people of Israel. The next day, Hazael returns to his master, tells him he will recover, and then takes a thick cloth, soaks it in water, and smothers the king to death. Hazael then succeeds him as king of Aram. The chapter concludes with a brief summary of the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah, wicked kings of Judah who were influenced by the house of Ahab.

## 2 Kings 9: The Anointing of Jehu and the Death of Joram and Jezebel

Elisha sets in motion the bloody purge of the house of Ahab that had been prophesied years earlier. He sends one of the young prophets to Ramoth Gilead, where the Israelite army is fighting the Arameans. The prophet is to find Jehu, a commander in the army, take him into a private room, and anoint him as the new king of Israel. He is also to deliver the Lord’s commission to Jehu: he is to destroy the entire house of Ahab to avenge the blood of the Lord’s prophets and servants. The young prophet carries out his instructions and then flees. When Jehu returns to his fellow officers, they ask him what the “madman” wanted. When he tells them he has been anointed king, they immediately throw their cloaks on the steps, blow the trumpet, and proclaim, “Jehu is king!”

Jehu immediately launches his coup. He rides his chariot furiously toward the city of Jezreel, where King Joram of Israel (also called Jehoram) is recovering from wounds he received in the battle at Ramoth. Ahaziah, the king of Judah, is also there, visiting Joram. When a watchman sees Jehu’s company approaching, Joram sends out two messengers, both of whom are forced to join Jehu’s ranks. Joram and Ahaziah then ride out in their own chariots to meet him. They meet at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Joram asks, “Is it peace, Jehu?” Jehu replies with a scathing denunciation of the idolatry and witchcraft of Joram’s mother, Jezebel. Realizing he has been betrayed, Joram turns to flee, but Jehu draws his bow and shoots him through the heart. Jehu orders his body to be thrown onto Naboth’s plot of land, in fulfillment of Elijah’s prophecy. Ahaziah also tries to flee but is wounded by Jehu’s men and later dies. Jehu then rides into Jezreel. The wicked Queen Jezebel, having painted her eyes and adorned her head, looks down from a window and taunts him. Jehu orders her eunuchs to throw her down. They obey, and she is trampled by the horses. When Jehu’s men later go to bury her, they find that the dogs have eaten most of her body, leaving only her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands, another grim fulfillment of Elijah’s prophecy.

## 2 Kings 10: Jehu’s Purge

Jehu continues his bloody purge of the house of Ahab. Ahab had seventy sons or male descendants living in the capital city of Samaria. Jehu sends a letter to the elders and guardians in Samaria, challenging them to choose the best of Ahab’s sons, put him on the throne, and fight for their master’s house. The officials, terrified of Jehu, refuse and pledge their loyalty to him. Jehu then sends a second letter with a gruesome demand: if they are on his side, they are to kill all seventy of Ahab’s sons and bring their heads to him in Jezreel by the next day. The officials obey, and the seventy heads are brought in baskets and piled up at the city gate. Jehu then addresses the people, acknowledging his own conspiracy against King Joram but pointing to the pile of heads as a fulfillment of the Lord’s prophecy against the house of Ahab.

Jehu proceeds to kill all of Ahab’s remaining relatives, his chief men, his close friends, and his priests in Jezreel, leaving no one. On his way to Samaria, he encounters a group of forty-two relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah, who are on their way to visit the royal family of Israel, unaware of the coup. Jehu has them all executed. He then meets Jehonadab, a religious zealot, and invites him to ride in his chariot to witness his “zeal for the Lord.” Once in Samaria, Jehu completes the slaughter of Ahab’s family. He then devises a cunning plan to eradicate Baal worship from Israel. He announces that he is going to hold a great festival for Baal and that he will serve Baal even more devotedly than Ahab did. He gathers all the prophets and worshippers of Baal from all over Israel into the temple of Baal in Samaria. Once they are all inside, he has his soldiers surround the temple and slaughter every single person. They then destroy the temple of Baal and turn it into a public latrine. The chapter concludes by noting that although Jehu wiped out Baal worship, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam—the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. The Lord promises Jehu that his descendants will sit on the throne of Israel for four generations, but the chapter also notes that during this time, the Lord begins to reduce the size of Israel, as Hazael of Aram conquers their territory east of the Jordan.

## 2 Kings 11: Athaliah and Joash

When Athaliah, the mother of the deceased King Ahaziah of Judah and the daughter of the wicked Ahab and Jezebel, learns that her son is dead, she seizes the opportunity to usurp the throne of Judah. To secure her power, she attempts to destroy the entire royal family of the house of David. However, Jehosheba, the sister of King Ahaziah and the wife of the high priest, Jehoiada, manages to rescue one of Ahaziah’s infant sons, Joash, and his nurse. She hides them in the Temple of the Lord for six years, while the wicked Athaliah reigns over the land.

In the seventh year, the high priest Jehoiada decides it is time to act. He secretly gathers the commanders of the royal guard, makes a covenant with them, and shows them the king’s son. He devises a careful plan for a coup d’état, to take place on the Sabbath. He arms the guards with the spears and shields from King David’s time that were stored in the Temple. At the appointed time, the guards form a protective cordon around the young Joash. Jehoiada then brings him out, places the crown on his head, gives him a copy of the covenant, and anoints him as king. The people clap their hands and shout, “God save the king!” When Athaliah hears the noise, she rushes to the Temple. Seeing the newly crowned king standing by the pillar, as was the custom, she tears her robes and cries, “Treason! Treason!” Jehoiada orders the guards to seize her and take her outside the Temple grounds to be executed. She is put to death at the entrance of the royal palace. Jehoiada then leads the king and the people in renewing their covenant with the Lord. The people rush to the temple of Baal, tear it down, smash its altars and images, and kill Mattan, the priest of Baal. The seven-year-old Joash takes his seat on the throne, and the land is at peace.

## 2 Kings 12: The Reign of Joash of Judah

Joash (also called Jehoash) reigns in Jerusalem for forty years, and for as long as he is instructed by the high priest Jehoiada, he does what is right in the eyes of the Lord. The one negative mark against his reign is that the high places, the local shrines where people offered sacrifices, are not removed. One of Joash’s major accomplishments is the repair of the Temple of the Lord, which had fallen into disrepair during the reigns of the house of Ahab.

Joash institutes a system for collecting money to fund the repairs. He instructs the priests to take all the money brought as offerings to the Temple and use it to hire carpenters, builders, masons, and stonecutters. However, for many years, the priests are slow to act, and the repairs are not made. Joash then summons Jehoiada and the other priests and implements a new system. A chest is made with a hole in the lid and is placed at the entrance to the Temple. The people bring their contributions, and when the chest is full, the king’s secretary and the high priest count the money and pay the workers directly. This system proves effective, and the Temple is restored. The chapter concludes with the end of Joash’s reign. Hazael, the king of Aram, captures the Philistine city of Gath and then turns to attack Jerusalem. Joash buys him off by sending him all the sacred objects from the Temple and the treasures of the royal palace. Sometime later, two of Joash’s officials conspire against him and assassinate him. He is succeeded by his son, Amaziah.

## 2 Kings 13: The Reigns of Jehoahaz and Jehoash of Israel

This chapter returns to the history of the northern kingdom of Israel. It covers the reigns of Jehoahaz and his son Jehoash (also called Joash), both of whom are wicked kings who continue in the sins of Jeroboam. During the reign of Jehoahaz, Israel is severely oppressed by Hazael, the king of Aram. The Israelite army is reduced to a tiny, powerless force. In his distress, Jehoahaz seeks the Lord’s favor, and the Lord, seeing their suffering, provides a deliverer who rescues them from Aramean oppression. Nevertheless, the people of Israel continue in their idolatrous ways.

The narrative then focuses on the end of the prophet Elisha’s life. King Jehoash of Israel, despite being a wicked king, clearly has some respect for the prophet. He comes to the dying Elisha and weeps over him, crying out the same words Elisha had cried out when Elijah was taken: “O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.” Elisha gives the king a prophetic sign. He tells him to take a bow and arrows and to shoot an arrow out of the east window. Elisha declares it to be “the Lord’s arrow of victory over Aram.” He then tells the king to strike the ground with the arrows. The king strikes the ground three times and then stops. Elisha is angry, telling him he should have struck the ground five or six times, which would have signified the complete destruction of Aram; now, he will only defeat them three times. After Elisha dies and is buried, a story is recounted of a dead man who is hastily thrown into Elisha’s tomb during a Moabite raid; when the body touches Elisha’s bones, the man comes back to life. The chapter concludes by noting that King Jehoash of Israel, in fulfillment of Elisha’s final prophecy, recaptures from the Arameans the cities they had taken from his father, defeating them three times.

## 2 Kings 14: Amaziah of Judah and Jeroboam II of Israel

This chapter continues the parallel histories of the kings of Judah and Israel. In Judah, Amaziah succeeds his father Joash. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, but not like his ancestor David. He executes the officials who had assassinated his father but, in obedience to the Law of Moses, he does not put their children to death. Like his predecessors, however, he does not remove the high places. After a successful military campaign against the Edomites, Amaziah, puffed up with pride, challenges Jehoash, the king of Israel, to a battle.

Jehoash of Israel sends back a mocking reply in the form of a fable about a thistle that arrogantly proposes a marriage alliance with a mighty cedar of Lebanon, only to be trampled by a wild beast. The message is clear: Amaziah should be content with his victory over Edom and not provoke a disastrous conflict with Israel. Amaziah, however, does not listen. The two armies meet, and Judah is routed. Jehoash of Israel captures Amaziah, marches on Jerusalem, breaks down a section of the city wall, and plunders the Temple and the royal palace. Some time later, conspirators in Jerusalem plot against Amaziah, and he flees to Lachish, but they pursue him and kill him there. He is succeeded by his son, Azariah (also known as Uzziah). The chapter then summarizes the long and prosperous reign of Jeroboam II in Israel. Although he is a wicked king, the Lord, seeing the bitter suffering of Israel, uses him to restore the nation’s boundaries to their former extent, a fulfillment of a prophecy by the prophet Jonah.

## 2 Kings 15: A Period of Decline and Instability

This chapter covers a chaotic and bloody period in the history of both kingdoms, particularly in the north. It begins with the long reign of Azariah (Uzziah) in Judah. He is a righteous king, but like his father, he does not remove the high places. For most of his reign, he is afflicted with leprosy, a judgment from the Lord for an act of pride (as detailed in the book of Chronicles), and his son Jotham acts as co-regent.

The history of the northern kingdom of Israel is a rapid succession of assassinations and short-lived dynasties. Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam II and the last of Jehu’s dynasty, reigns for only six months before he is assassinated by Shallum. Shallum reigns for a mere month before he is assassinated by Menahem. Menahem’s reign is marked by extreme brutality. During his reign, Pul (also known as Tiglath-Pileser III), the powerful king of Assyria, invades the land. Menahem buys him off with a massive tribute of a thousand talents of silver, which he raises by levying a tax on the wealthy men of Israel. Menahem is succeeded by his son Pekahiah, who reigns for two years before he is assassinated by Pekah, one of his chief officers. Pekah’s reign is also marked by the growing threat of Assyria; Tiglath-Pileser returns and conquers large portions of Israel’s northern territories, deporting the inhabitants to Assyria. Pekah is then assassinated by Hoshea. In Judah, Jotham succeeds his father Azariah and is a righteous king, though the high places still remain. He is succeeded by his son, the wicked king Ahaz.

## 2 Kings 16: The Wicked Reign of Ahaz of Judah

Ahaz, the king of Judah, is one of the most wicked kings in the nation’s history. He does not do what is right in the eyes of the Lord but walks in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even goes so far as to sacrifice his own son in the fire, an abominable practice of the surrounding nations. He also offers sacrifices and burns incense at the high places, on the hilltops, and under every spreading tree.

During his reign, Rezin, the king of Aram, and Pekah, the king of Israel, form an alliance and attack Judah, besieging Jerusalem. They are unable to conquer the city, but they inflict significant damage. In his desperation, Ahaz makes a fateful decision that will have long-term consequences for Judah. He sends a message to Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, declaring himself to be his “servant and vassal” and asking for help against the kings of Aram and Israel. He sends a massive bribe, taking the silver and gold from the Temple and the royal palace. The king of Assyria agrees, attacks Damascus, captures it, deports its people, and kills King Rezin. While in Damascus to meet with the Assyrian king, Ahaz sees an altar that he admires. He sends a sketch of it back to the priest Urijah in Jerusalem, with instructions to build a replica. When Ahaz returns, he replaces the bronze altar of the Lord in the Temple with this new, pagan-style altar. He also makes other alterations to the Temple to please the king of Assyria. Ahaz’s reign is a period of profound spiritual and political decline for Judah.

## 2 Kings 17: The Fall of Israel and the Origin of the Samaritans

This chapter records the final downfall of the northern kingdom of Israel. Hoshea, the last king of Israel, is a vassal of Assyria. He conspires against the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser V, by sending envoys to Egypt and by failing to pay the annual tribute. In response, the king of Assyria marches against Israel, besieges the capital city of Samaria for three years, and captures it. He deports the Israelites to various parts of the Assyrian empire. This catastrophic event is the culmination of centuries of idolatry and disobedience.

The chapter provides a lengthy theological explanation for the fall of Israel. It recounts how the people had forsaken the Lord their God, who had brought them out of Egypt, and had worshipped other gods, following the practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before them. They had secretly done things against the Lord, built high places in all their towns, set up sacred stones and Asherah poles, and worshipped all the starry hosts. They had ignored the repeated warnings of the prophets and had followed the pattern of sin established by their first king, Jeroboam. Because of their persistent rebellion, the Lord became angry and removed them from His presence, leaving only the tribe of Judah.

The king of Assyria then repopulates the cities of Samaria with people from other conquered lands, including Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim. These new inhabitants do not worship the Lord, and the Lord sends lions among them, which kill some of them. The king of Assyria, believing this is because they do not know the “god of the land,” sends one of the exiled Israelite priests back to teach them how to worship the Lord. The result is a syncretistic religion: the people learn about the Lord, but they also continue to worship their own gods. This mixed population becomes known as the Samaritans, and their hybrid religion is a source of conflict with the Jews for centuries to come.

## 2 Kings 18: Hezekiah’s Reforms and Sennacherib’s Invasion

The narrative now turns to the southern kingdom of Judah and the reign of the righteous King Hezekiah. Hezekiah is one of Judah’s best kings; he “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father did.” He institutes a series of sweeping religious reforms, removing the high places, smashing the sacred stones, and cutting down the Asherah poles. He even breaks into pieces the bronze snake that Moses had made, because the Israelites had been burning incense to it. He trusts in the Lord, holds fast to Him, and prospers in all he does. In the early years of his reign, the Assyrians complete their conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel.

In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib, the powerful king of Assyria, invades Judah and captures all of its fortified cities. Hezekiah, in a moment of weakness, sends a message to Sennacherib, offering to pay whatever tribute he demands. Sennacherib demands a massive payment of silver and gold, and Hezekiah is forced to strip the Temple and the royal palace of all their treasures to meet the demand. Despite this payment, Sennacherib sends his top commanders with a large army to besiege Jerusalem. One of the commanders, the Rabshakeh, stands by the aqueduct of the upper pool and delivers a series of arrogant and blasphemous speeches in Hebrew, so that all the people on the city wall can hear. He mocks Hezekiah’s reliance on Egypt and on the Lord, boasting that no god of any other nation has been able to deliver his people from the hand of the king of Assyria. Hezekiah’s officials, following the king’s command, do not answer him a word.

## 2 Kings 19: God’s Deliverance

When King Hezekiah hears the report of the Rabshakeh’s blasphemous speech, he tears his clothes, puts on sackcloth, and goes to the Temple of the Lord. He sends his officials, also in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah to ask for his help. Isaiah sends back a message from the Lord, telling Hezekiah not to be afraid. The Lord declares that He will put a spirit in Sennacherib, so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where he will be killed. Sennacherib does temporarily withdraw to deal with another battle, but he sends another threatening letter to Hezekiah, again mocking the Lord.

Hezekiah takes the letter to the Temple, spreads it out before the Lord, and offers a powerful prayer. He acknowledges the Lord as the one true God over all the kingdoms of the earth and admits that the kings of Assyria have indeed destroyed other nations and their gods, which were merely wood and stone. He then pleads with the Lord to deliver Jerusalem from Sennacherib, “that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God, even thou only.” In response, the Lord sends a message through the prophet Isaiah. He delivers a long oracle against Sennacherib, mocking his pride and arrogance. The Lord declares that it is He who has ordained Assyria’s victories but that now, because of Sennacherib’s rage and insolence against Him, He will put a hook in his nose and a bit in his mouth and will turn him back by the way he came. As a sign, Isaiah says that for two years the people will eat what grows of itself, but in the third year, they will sow and reap and plant vineyards. That very night, the angel of the Lord goes out to the Assyrian camp and puts to death 185,000 soldiers. In the morning, the camp is full of dead bodies. Sennacherib breaks camp and returns to his capital, Nineveh. Some time later, while he is worshipping in the temple of his god, two of his sons assassinate him and escape. He is succeeded by another son.

## 2 Kings 20: Hezekiah’s Illness and the Babylonian Envoys

In those days, Hezekiah becomes ill and is at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah comes to him and tells him to put his house in order, because he is going to die. Hezekiah turns his face to the wall and prays earnestly to the Lord, weeping bitterly and reminding the Lord of his faithful service. Before Isaiah has even left the middle court of the palace, the word of the Lord comes to him, telling him to go back and tell Hezekiah that the Lord has heard his prayer and seen his tears and will heal him. He will add fifteen years to his life and will deliver him and the city from the king of Assyria. As a sign, Isaiah has a poultice of figs applied to the king’s boil, and he recovers. Hezekiah asks for a further sign, and Isaiah offers him a choice: the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz can either go forward ten steps or backward ten steps. Hezekiah chooses the more difficult sign, and the Lord makes the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down.

Sometime later, Merodach-Baladan, the king of Babylon, sends envoys with a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard of his illness and recovery. Hezekiah, in a foolish act of pride, welcomes the envoys and shows them everything in his palace and his kingdom—all his treasures, his armory, and all his wealth. There is nothing he does not show them. The prophet Isaiah then comes to Hezekiah and asks him about the visitors. When Hezekiah tells him what he has done, Isaiah delivers a grim prophecy: the time will come when everything in his palace, and all that his predecessors have stored up, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left. Even some of his own descendants will be taken away and will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Hezekiah’s response is strangely passive; he says, “Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken,” for he thinks, “Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?”

## 2 Kings 21: The Wicked Reigns of Manasseh and Amon

This chapter describes one of the darkest periods in the history of Judah. Hezekiah is succeeded by his son, Manasseh, who is only twelve years old when he begins to reign. His fifty-five-year reign is a catastrophic reversal of his father’s righteous reforms. Manasseh is arguably the most wicked king in Judah’s history. He rebuilds the high places that his father had destroyed, erects altars for Baal, and makes an Asherah pole, just as Ahab of Israel had done. He worships all the starry hosts and even builds altars for them in the two courts of the Temple of the Lord. He sacrifices his own son in the fire, practices divination and sorcery, and consults mediums and spiritists. He even takes the carved Asherah pole he had made and puts it in the Temple itself, the place of which the Lord had said, “In this house will I put my name for ever.”

Manasseh leads the people of Judah so far astray that they do more evil than the pagan nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites. The chapter also notes that he “shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another.” Because of this massive and unrepentant apostasy, the Lord, through His prophets, pronounces a devastating judgment on Judah and Jerusalem. He declares that He will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. He will forsake the remnant of His inheritance and give them into the hands of their enemies. Manasseh is succeeded by his son Amon, who continues in his father’s wicked ways. After a reign of only two years, Amon is assassinated by his officials. The people of the land, however, execute the conspirators and place Amon’s young son, Josiah, on the throne.

## 2 Kings 22: The Discovery of the Book of the Law

Josiah is only eight years old when he becomes king, and he reigns for thirty-one years. In stark contrast to his father and grandfather, he “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father.” In the eighteenth year of his reign, Josiah begins a project to repair the Temple of the Lord. He sends his secretary, Shaphan, to the high priest, Hilkiah, to arrange for the money that has been collected to be given to the workers.

During the course of the repairs, Hilkiah the high priest makes a momentous discovery: he finds “the book of the law in the house of the Lord,” likely a copy of the book of Deuteronomy that had been lost or hidden during the apostate reigns of Manasseh and Amon. He gives the scroll to Shaphan, who reads it and then brings it to King Josiah. When Shaphan reads the words of the book to the king, Josiah is overcome with grief and remorse. He tears his robes, realizing how far the nation has strayed from the Lord’s commands and how great the Lord’s anger must be against them. He sends a delegation, including Hilkiah and Shaphan, to inquire of the Lord. They go to a prophetess named Huldah, who delivers a message from the Lord. She confirms that the disasters threatened in the book will indeed come upon the nation because of their disobedience. However, because Josiah’s heart was responsive and he humbled himself before the Lord, the disaster will not happen in his lifetime. He will be gathered to his grave in peace.

## 2 Kings 23: Josiah’s Reforms and His Death

In response to the prophecy of Huldah, King Josiah gathers all the elders and people of Judah and Jerusalem at the Temple. He reads to them all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found. He then stands by the pillar and renews the covenant, pledging to follow the Lord and to keep His commands with all his heart and all his soul. All the people pledge themselves to the covenant as well. Josiah then launches the most extensive and thorough religious reformation in Judah’s history. He purges the Temple of all the articles made for Baal and Asherah. He deposes the idolatrous priests and tears down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes. He goes throughout the land, from Geba to Beersheba, desecrating the high places and bringing the priests from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem.

His reforms extend even into the territory of the former northern kingdom. He goes to the altar at Bethel, the original site of Jeroboam’s sin, and desecrates it, burning human bones on it, thus fulfilling the prophecy made by the man of God from Judah centuries earlier. He gets rid of all the shrines of the high places in the towns of Samaria. He also gets rid of the mediums and spiritists and all the other detestable idols in the land. After the purge, Josiah commands the people to celebrate the Passover, and it is celebrated with a devotion and on a scale not seen since the days of the judges. The chapter concludes by noting that despite Josiah’s righteousness, the Lord’s fierce anger against Judah, kindled by the sins of Manasseh, is not turned away. The end of Josiah’s reign comes unexpectedly. Pharaoh Necho of Egypt is marching his army north to assist the king of Assyria. For reasons that are not entirely clear, Josiah goes out to confront him at Megiddo. Pharaoh Necho sends him a message, telling him the fight is not with him, but Josiah persists. In the ensuing battle, Josiah is killed. His body is brought back to Jerusalem, and the people mourn him deeply. He is succeeded by his son Jehoahaz.

## 2 Kings 24: The Babylonian Exile Begins

The final decline of Judah happens swiftly after the death of the righteous King Josiah. His son Jehoahaz reigns for only three months before Pharaoh Necho deposes him, puts him in chains, and takes him to Egypt, where he dies. The Pharaoh imposes a heavy tribute on Judah and makes Jehoahaz’s brother, Eliakim, the new king, changing his name to Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim is a wicked king who raises the tribute by taxing the people. During his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, the powerful king of Babylon, comes onto the scene and becomes the new dominant power in the region. Jehoiakim becomes his vassal for three years but then rebels.

In response, the Lord sends Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Judah to destroy it, in fulfillment of the warnings of the prophets. This is all attributed to the Lord’s command, to remove Judah from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh and the innocent blood he had shed. Jehoiakim is succeeded by his son, Jehoiachin, who also does evil in the eyes of the Lord. After a reign of only three months, Nebuchadnezzar’s army besieges Jerusalem. Jehoiachin surrenders to the king of Babylon. In this first major deportation, in 597 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar carries off the king, his family, his officials, and 10,000 of the leading citizens and skilled workers of Jerusalem into exile in Babylon. He also plunders the Temple and the royal palace, taking all the treasures, including the golden articles that Solomon had made. Nebuchadnezzar then installs Jehoiachin’s uncle, Mattaniah, as the new king of Judah, changing his name to Zedekiah.

## 2 Kings 25: The Fall of Jerusalem and the Exile

Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, is a puppet king installed by Nebuchadnezzar. He reigns for eleven years and, like his predecessors, does evil in the eyes of the Lord. He eventually rebels against the king of Babylon. In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army march against Jerusalem, build siege works around it, and lay siege to the city. The siege lasts for two years, and the famine in the city becomes so severe that there is no food for the people. Finally, the city wall is breached. King Zedekiah and his soldiers flee by night but are captured on the plains of Jericho. They are taken to Nebuchadnezzar at his headquarters in Riblah. There, Zedekiah is forced to watch as his sons are executed. Then, his own eyes are put out, he is bound in bronze shackles, and he is taken to Babylon.

A month later, Nebuzaradan, the commander of Nebuchadnezzar’s imperial guard, arrives in Jerusalem to carry out the final destruction of the city. He sets fire to the Temple of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the great houses of Jerusalem. The Babylonian army demolishes the walls of the city. Nebuzaradan deports most of the remaining population to Babylon, leaving only the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields. The Babylonians strip the Temple of its remaining bronze, silver, and gold, breaking the great bronze pillars and the Sea into pieces to be carried away. The chief priest, the second priest, and other leading officials are taken to Riblah and executed. The kingdom of Judah is no more. The chapter concludes with a brief account of Gedaliah, who is appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the remnant left in the land. He is soon assassinated, and the remaining people, fearing Babylonian reprisals, flee to Egypt. The final verses of the book provide a small glimmer of hope, recounting that years later, in Babylon, Jehoiachin, the exiled king of Judah, is released from prison by the new Babylonian king, given a place of honor, and provided for by the king for the rest of his life.
