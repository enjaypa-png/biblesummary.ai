# Lamentations

## Lamentations 1: Jerusalem’s Sorrow

The narrator describes Jerusalem sitting alone like a widow who once was great among the nations. The city that was princess among provinces now becomes a slave, and she weeps bitterly in the night with tears on her cheeks. None of her lovers comfort her, and all her friends deal treacherously with her and become her enemies. Judah goes into captivity because of affliction and great servitude, and she dwells among the nations but finds no rest. Her pursuers overtake her between narrow places, and the ways of Zion mourn because no one comes to the solemn feasts.

Her gates are desolate, her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness. Her adversaries become chief, and her enemies prosper, because the LORD afflicts her for the multitude of her transgressions. Her children go into captivity before the enemy, and from the daughter of Zion all her beauty departs. Her princes become like deer that find no pasture, and they go without strength before the pursuer. Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old.

Jerusalem speaks as one person and says the LORD is righteous, for she rebels against His commandment. She calls to all people to see if there is any sorrow like her sorrow, which the LORD lays upon her in the day of His fierce anger. She says that from above He sends fire into her bones and spreads a net for her feet and turns her back. She confesses that her transgressions are bound by His hand and come upon her neck, and the Lord delivers her into the hands of those she cannot stand before. She asks the LORD to look upon her affliction, for the enemy magnifies himself, and she calls for Him to consider her reproach and judge her enemies as He has judged her.

## Lamentations 2: The Lord’s Anger Against Zion

The narrator describes how the Lord covers the daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger. He casts down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel and does not remember His footstool in the day of His anger. He swallows up all the habitations of Jacob and throws down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He cuts off all the horn of Israel and draws back His right hand from before the enemy, burning against Jacob like a flaming fire that devours round about.

The Lord stands like an enemy and bends His bow and kills all that are pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion. He violently takes away His tabernacle and destroys His place of assembly and causes the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion. The LORD casts off His altar and abhors His sanctuary and gives up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces, and they make a noise in the house of the LORD as in the day of a solemn feast. He destroys the walls of the daughter of Zion and stretches out a line and does not withdraw His hand from destroying.

The narrator describes children and infants fainting in the streets of the city and asking for grain and wine from their mothers. The prophets see vain and foolish things and do not expose iniquity to turn away captivity. All who pass by clap their hands and hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, and the enemies open their mouth against her and say they swallow her up and this is the day they look for. The narrator urges the daughter of Zion to cry to the Lord and pour out her heart like water before His face and lift up her hands for the life of her young children. Jerusalem calls on the LORD to behold and consider to whom He does this, describing women eating their own fruit and priests and prophets slain in the sanctuary in the day of His anger.

## Lamentations 3: Great Is Your Faithfulness

The afflicted man speaks and says he is the man who sees affliction by the rod of His wrath. He says the LORD leads him into darkness and sets him in dark places like those long dead. He feels hedged about and shut out from prayer, and he says God makes his chain heavy and blocks his ways with hewn stone. He describes God as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret places who turns aside his ways and tears him in pieces. He says the LORD bends His bow and sets him as a mark for the arrow and fills him with bitterness and makes him drunk with wormwood.

He remembers his affliction and misery and says his soul is humbled within him. He then recalls that it is of the LORD’s mercies that they are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. He says they are new every morning and great is His faithfulness. He declares that the LORD is his portion and therefore he hopes in Him. He says the Lord is good to those who wait for Him and that it is good to bear the yoke in youth and to sit alone and keep silence when He lays it upon him.

The speaker says the Lord does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men, yet He sees all oppression and wrong. He calls for searching and trying their ways and turning again to the LORD and lifting up heart and hands to God in the heavens. He confesses that they transgress and rebel and that God covers with anger and persecutes. He describes the people as offscouring and refuse among the nations and recounts fear and a snare and destruction. He says his eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of his people and asks the LORD to consider and see his reproach and judge those who pursue him.

## Lamentations 4: The Tarnished Gold of Zion

The narrator describes how the gold becomes dim and the most fine gold changes, with the stones of the sanctuary poured out in the top of every street. The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, are counted as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter. Even the sea monsters draw out the breast and give suck to their young, but the daughter of my people becomes cruel like ostriches in the wilderness. The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst, and the young children ask bread and no one breaks it for them.

Those who eat delicately are desolate in the streets, and those who are brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. The punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom. Her Nazarites are purer than snow and whiter than milk, but now their visage is blacker than coal and they are not known in the streets. Those slain with the sword are better than those slain with hunger, for these pine away stricken through for lack of the fruits of the field. The hands of pitiful women boil their own children and they are their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

The LORD accomplishes His fury and pours out His fierce anger and kindles a fire in Zion that devours the foundations. The kings of the earth and all inhabitants of the world do not believe that the adversary should enter into the gates of Jerusalem. It happens for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. They wander as blind men in the streets and are polluted with blood so that men cannot touch their garments. The chapter ends with words to the daughter of Edom, saying her iniquity shall be visited and uncovered, and to the daughter of Zion, saying her punishment is accomplished and she shall no more go into captivity.

## Lamentations 5: Remember Us, O LORD

The people speak and ask the LORD to remember what is come upon them and consider and behold their reproach. They say their inheritance turns to strangers and their houses to aliens. They are orphans and fatherless, and their mothers are as widows. They drink their water for money and their wood is sold to them. Their necks are under persecution and they labor and have no rest.

They say servants rule over them and there is none to deliver them out of their hand. They get their bread with peril of their lives because of the sword of the wilderness. Their skin is black like an oven because of the terrible famine. Princes are hanged up by their hand and the faces of elders are not honored. Young men bear the mill and children fall under the wood.

The elders cease from the gate and the young men from their music. The joy of their heart ceases and their dance turns into mourning. The crown falls from their head, and they say woe unto us because they sin. They describe Mount Zion as desolate and foxes walking upon it. The people acknowledge that the LORD remains forever and His throne from generation to generation, and they ask why He forgets them so long. They plead for Him to turn them to Himself and renew their days as of old, even though He has utterly rejected them and is very angry with them.
