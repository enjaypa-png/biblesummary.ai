# 2 Chronicles Summary (KJV)

## 2 Chronicles 1: Solomon's Wisdom and Wealth

Solomon, the son of David, is now firmly established in his kingdom, and the Lord his God is with him, magnifying him exceedingly. Solomon speaks to all Israel—the commanders, judges, and leaders—and the entire assembly goes with him to the high place at Gibeon, where the Tabernacle of the Lord that Moses had made in the wilderness is located. The Ark of God, however, is in Jerusalem, in the tent that David had pitched for it. At Gibeon, Solomon goes up to the bronze altar before the Lord and offers a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

That night, God appears to Solomon and says, "Ask what I shall give thee." Solomon responds with humility and wisdom. He acknowledges that God has shown great mercy to his father David and has made him king in his place. He asks God for wisdom and knowledge to lead the people, saying, "Who can judge this thy people, that is so great?" God is pleased with Solomon's request because he did not ask for wealth, possessions, honor, the death of his enemies, or even a long life. God grants him wisdom and knowledge, and He also gives him wealth, possessions, and honor such as no king before him has had and none after him will have. Solomon returns from Gibeon to Jerusalem and reigns over Israel. The chapter concludes by describing Solomon's accumulation of chariots and horses and his immense wealth, noting that silver and gold become as common in Jerusalem as stones.

## 2 Chronicles 2: Preparations for Building the Temple

Solomon determines to build a temple for the name of the Lord and a royal palace for himself. He conscripts 70,000 men to be carriers, 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hill country, and 3,600 foremen to supervise them. Solomon sends a message to Hiram (also called Huram), the king of Tyre, reminding him of the assistance he had given to David and requesting his help in this great project. Solomon asks Hiram to send him cedar, juniper, and algum logs from Lebanon, for he knows that Hiram's servants are skilled in cutting timber. He also requests that Hiram send him a skilled craftsman to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, and fabric, to work alongside the skilled workers in Judah and Jerusalem whom David had prepared.

Hiram responds with a letter praising the Lord for giving David such a wise son. He agrees to provide the timber Solomon needs, having his men cut it in Lebanon and float it by sea to Joppa, from where Solomon's men can transport it to Jerusalem. Hiram also sends a master craftsman named Huram-Abi, whose mother is from the tribe of Dan and whose father is from Tyre, skilled in all kinds of work. Solomon then takes a census of all the foreigners living in Israel, following the example of his father David, and finds there are 153,600. He assigns them to the labor force for the Temple project.

## 2 Chronicles 3: The Construction of the Temple

Solomon begins to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, the place where the Lord had appeared to his father David, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, which David had prepared. He begins construction in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. The foundation Solomon lays for building the Temple of God is sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, using the old standard of measurement. The portico at the front of the Temple is twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the building, and twenty cubits high. He overlays the inside with pure gold.

The main hall is paneled with juniper and overlaid with fine gold, decorated with palm tree and chain designs. He adorns the Temple with precious stones, and the gold he uses is gold of Parvaim. He overlays the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls, and doors of the Temple with gold, and he carves cherubim on the walls. He builds the Most Holy Place, making it a perfect square of twenty cubits by twenty cubits, and overlays it with six hundred talents of fine gold. Inside the Most Holy Place, he makes two cherubim of sculptured work and overlays them with gold. The total wingspan of the cherubim is twenty cubits, with each wing being five cubits long. He also makes the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it. In front of the Temple, he makes two pillars, each thirty-five cubits high, with capitals on top that are five cubits high. He makes chains and puts them on top of the pillars, and he makes a hundred pomegranates and attaches them to the chains. He erects the pillars in the front of the Temple, one to the south and one to the north, naming them Jakin and Boaz.

## 2 Chronicles 4: The Temple Furnishings

Solomon makes a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. He also makes the Sea, a massive circular basin cast in metal, ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference. Below the rim, figures of bulls encircle it, ten to a cubit, cast in two rows as part of the Sea itself. The Sea stands on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east, with their hindquarters toward the center. It is a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim is fashioned like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It holds three thousand baths of water.

He makes ten basins for washing and places five on the south side and five on the north, to be used for rinsing the things used for the burnt offerings. The Sea, however, is for the priests to wash in. He makes ten gold lampstands according to the specifications and places them in the Temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He makes ten tables and places them in the Temple, five on the south side and five on the north, and he makes a hundred gold sprinkling bowls. He makes the courtyard of the priests and the large court, and the doors for the court, overlaying them with bronze. He places the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner. Huram also makes the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls, completing all the work he undertakes for King Solomon for the Temple of God. The chapter provides a detailed inventory of all the bronze and gold furnishings, noting that Solomon makes so many bronze articles that the weight of the bronze is not determined. Solomon also makes all the furnishings for the Temple of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence, the lampstands and their lamps, the gold floral work and lamps and tongs, the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes, and censers, and the gold doors of the Temple.

## 2 Chronicles 5: The Ark Brought to the Temple

When all the work Solomon does for the Temple of the Lord is finished, he brings in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver, gold, and all the furnishings—and he places them in the treasuries of God's Temple. Solomon then assembles the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes in Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Lord's Covenant from Zion, the City of David. All the Israelites come together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month. When all the elders of Israel arrive, the Levites take up the Ark, and they bring up the Ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carry them up.

King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that has gathered about him are before the Ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they cannot be recorded or counted. The priests then bring the Ark of the Lord's Covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the Temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the Ark and cover the Ark and its carrying poles. The poles are so long that their ends can be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside. There is nothing in the Ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. When the priests withdraw from the Holy Place, all the priests who are there have consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions. All the Levites who are musicians stand on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. The trumpeters and musicians join in unison to give praise and thanks to the Lord, and as they raise their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and other instruments in praise to the Lord, singing, "He is good; his love endures forever," the Temple of the Lord is filled with a cloud, and the priests cannot perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord fills the Temple of God.

## 2 Chronicles 6: Solomon's Prayer of Dedication

Solomon then addresses the assembly, saying, "The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud; I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever." He turns around and blesses the whole assembly of Israel while they are standing there. He praises the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hands has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to David. He recounts how David had desired to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, but God had told him that his son would be the one to build it. Solomon declares that the Lord has kept the promise he made, for he has succeeded David and has built the temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and he has placed the Ark in it, in which is the covenant of the Lord.

Solomon then stands before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spreads out his hands. He has made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high and has placed it in the center of the outer court. He stands on it, kneels down before the whole assembly, spreads out his hands toward heaven, and prays. His prayer is a magnificent expression of faith and intercession. He acknowledges that the Lord is the God of Israel and that there is no God like Him in heaven or on earth, who keeps His covenant of love with His servants who continue wholeheartedly in His way. He acknowledges that even the highest heavens cannot contain God, much less this temple he has built. Yet he asks that God's eyes may be open toward this temple day and night and that He would hear the prayers His people pray toward this place. He then offers a series of specific petitions, asking God to hear and forgive when people sin, when they are defeated by enemies, when there is drought or famine or plague, when foreigners come to pray, when the people go to war, and when they are taken captive to a foreign land. He concludes by asking the Lord to arise and come to His resting place, along with the Ark of His might, and to let His priests be clothed with salvation and His faithful people rejoice in His goodness.

## 2 Chronicles 7: God's Response and Warning

When Solomon finishes praying, fire comes down from heaven and consumes the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord fills the Temple. The priests cannot enter the Temple of the Lord because the glory of the Lord fills it. When all the Israelites see the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the Temple, they kneel on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worship and give thanks to the Lord, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever." Then the king and all the people offer sacrifices before the Lord. King Solomon offers a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicate the Temple of God. The priests take their positions, as do the Levites with the Lord's musical instruments, and they play music to accompany the singing, "His love endures forever." The festival lasts for seven days, and then they observe the dedication of the altar for seven more days. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sends the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the Lord has done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.

That night, the Lord appears to Solomon and says to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices." God then gives both a promise and a warning. He promises that if He shuts up the heavens so that there is no rain, or commands locusts to devour the land, or sends a plague among His people, and if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray and seek His face and turn from their wicked ways, then He will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. His eyes will be open and His ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. However, God also gives a stern warning: if Solomon or his descendants turn away and forsake the decrees and commands He has given them and go off to serve other gods and worship them, then He will uproot Israel from His land, reject this temple, and make Israel a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.

## 2 Chronicles 8: Solomon's Other Achievements

At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon builds the Temple of the Lord and his own palace, Solomon rebuilds the villages that Hiram has given him and settles Israelites in them. Solomon then goes to Hamath Zobah and captures it. He also builds up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he has built in Hamath. He rebuilds Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars, as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses. He builds whatever he desires to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the territory he rules.

There are still people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—people who are not Israelites. Solomon conscripts their descendants who remain in the land, whom the Israelites have not destroyed, to serve as slave laborers, as they still are today. But Solomon does not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they are his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers. They are also King Solomon's chief officials—two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men. Solomon brings Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he has built for her, for he says, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the Lord has entered are holy." Solomon then sacrifices burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar he has built in front of the portico. He follows the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three annual festivals. He appoints the divisions of the priests for their duties and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appoints the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates. Solomon also builds a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, and Hiram sends his servants, experienced sailors, to serve with Solomon's men. They sail to Ophir and bring back 450 talents of gold, which they deliver to King Solomon.

## 2 Chronicles 9: The Queen of Sheba and Solomon's Splendor

When the queen of Sheba hears of Solomon's fame, she comes to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrives with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones. She comes to Solomon and talks with him about all that she has on her mind. Solomon answers all her questions; nothing is too hard for him to explain to her. When the queen of Sheba sees the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he has built, the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes, and the burnt offerings he makes at the temple of the Lord, she is overwhelmed.

She says to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard." She praises the happiness of his people and his officials who continually stand before him and hear his wisdom. She praises the Lord his God, who has delighted in him and placed him on his throne as king to rule for the Lord. She gives the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. King Solomon gives the queen of Sheba all she desires and asks for, more than she has brought to him. Then she and her attendants return to her own country. The chapter continues with a detailed description of Solomon's wealth, noting that the weight of the gold that comes to Solomon yearly is 666 talents, not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. He makes two hundred large shields of hammered gold and three hundred small shields of hammered gold. He makes a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with gold. The throne has six steps, a footstool of gold, armrests, and two lions standing beside the armrests, with twelve lions standing on the six steps. Nothing like it has ever been made for any other kingdom. All King Solomon's goblets are gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon are pure gold. Silver is considered of little value in Solomon's day. Solomon's wealth and wisdom exceed those of all the other kings of the earth, and the whole world seeks audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God has put in his heart. Solomon reigns in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. Then he rests with his ancestors and is buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son succeeds him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 10: The Kingdom Divides

Rehoboam goes to Shechem, for all Israel has gone there to make him king. When Jeroboam son of Nebat hears of this (he is in Egypt, where he has fled from King Solomon), he returns from Egypt. The people send for him, and Jeroboam and all Israel go to Rehoboam and say to him, "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you." Rehoboam answers, "Come back to me in three days." So the people go away.

King Rehoboam consults the elders who have served his father Solomon during his lifetime, asking, "How would you advise me to answer these people?" They reply, "If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants." But Rehoboam rejects the advice the elders give him and consults the young men who have grown up with him and are serving him. He asks them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?" The young men who have grown up with him reply, "The people have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.' Now tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'" Three days later, Jeroboam and all the people return to Rehoboam, and the king answers them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders, he follows the advice of the young men. When all Israel sees that the king refuses to listen to them, they answer the king: "What share do we have in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David, see to your own house." So all Israel goes to their tents. Rehoboam sends out Hadoram, who is in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stone him to death. King Rehoboam manages to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. So Israel rebels against the house of David to this day.

## 2 Chronicles 11: Rehoboam Strengthens Judah

When Rehoboam arrives in Jerusalem, he musters Judah and Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam. But the word of the Lord comes to Shemaiah the man of God: "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 'This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your relatives. Return home, every one of you, for this thing is from me.'" So they obey the words of the Lord and turn back from going against Jeroboam.

Rehoboam lives in Jerusalem and builds up towns for defense in Judah, including Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. He fortifies these strongholds and appoints commanders over them, putting supplies of food, oil, and wine in them. He puts shields and spears in all the cities and makes them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin are his. The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel side with him, for Jeroboam and his sons have rejected them as priests of the Lord, appointing his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he has made. Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the Lord, the God of Israel, follow the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors. They strengthen the kingdom of Judah and support Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, walking in the way of David and Solomon during that time. Rehoboam takes as wife Mahalath, daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, daughter of Eliab son of Jesse, and she bears him sons. He then takes Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bears him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. Rehoboam loves Maakah more than any of his other wives and concubines. He has eighteen wives and sixty concubines and fathers twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Rehoboam appoints Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king. He acts wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin and to all the fortified cities. He provides them with abundant provisions and seeks many wives for them.

## 2 Chronicles 12: Shishak's Invasion

After Rehoboam's position as king is established and he has become strong, he and all Israel with him abandon the law of the Lord. Because they have been unfaithful to the Lord, Shishak king of Egypt attacks Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam. With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites that come with him from Egypt, he captures the fortified cities of Judah and comes as far as Jerusalem.

Then the prophet Shemaiah comes to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who have assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he says to them, "This is what the Lord says: 'You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'" The leaders of Israel and the king humble themselves and say, "The Lord is righteous." When the Lord sees that they have humbled themselves, the word of the Lord comes to Shemaiah: "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will grant them some deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak. They will, however, become his subjects, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands." Shishak king of Egypt attacks Jerusalem and carries off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. He takes everything, including the gold shields Solomon has made. So King Rehoboam makes bronze shields to replace them and commits them to the care of the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. Whenever the king goes to the Lord's temple, the guards bear them and afterward return them to the guardroom. Rehoboam strengthens himself in Jerusalem and reigns. He is forty-one years old when he becomes king, and he reigns seventeen years in Jerusalem. He does evil because he does not set his heart to seek the Lord. Rehoboam rests with his ancestors and is buried in the City of David, and Abijah his son succeeds him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 13: Abijah's War with Jeroboam

In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah becomes king of Judah, and he reigns in Jerusalem for three years. There is war between Abijah and Jeroboam. Abijah goes into battle with an army of four hundred thousand chosen men, and Jeroboam draws up in battle array against him eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty men of valor. Abijah stands on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and addresses Jeroboam and all Israel. He delivers a powerful speech, reminding them that the Lord, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt. He accuses Jeroboam of rebelling against his master and of driving out the priests of the Lord and the Levites, appointing his own priests for the high places, just as the peoples of other lands do. He declares that Judah has not forsaken the Lord, that the priests who serve the Lord are sons of Aaron, and that the Levites assist them. He warns them, "Do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper."

Despite this speech, Jeroboam has sent an ambush to come from the rear, so that while he is in front of Judah, the ambush is behind them. Judah turns, and behold, the battle is both in front of and behind them. They cry to the Lord, and the priests blow the trumpets. The men of Judah give a shout, and as they shout, God smites Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. The men of Israel flee before Judah, and God delivers them into their hand. Abijah and his people slay them with a great slaughter, so that five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fall slain. Thus the children of Israel are subdued at that time, and the children of Judah prevail because they rely on the Lord, the God of their fathers. Abijah pursues Jeroboam and takes from him several cities, including Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. Jeroboam does not recover strength in the days of Abijah, and the Lord strikes him, and he dies. But Abijah grows mighty, takes fourteen wives, and fathers twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.

## 2 Chronicles 14: Asa's Reforms and Victory

Abijah rests with his fathers and is buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeds him as king, and in his days the land has rest for ten years. Asa does what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God. He removes the foreign altars and the high places, breaks down the sacred pillars, and cuts down the Asherah poles. He commands Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment. He also removes the high places and incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom is at rest under him. He builds fortified cities in Judah, for the land has rest, and there is no war during those years because the Lord gives him rest.

Asa says to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the Lord our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side." So they build and prosper. Asa has an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin bearing shields and drawing bows. All these are mighty men of valor. Zerah the Ethiopian comes out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots and comes as far as Mareshah. Asa goes out to meet him, and they draw up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. Then Asa calls to the Lord his God and says, "Lord, there is none besides thee to help between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Lord our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee." So the Lord smites the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians flee. Asa and the people pursue them to Gerar, and the Ethiopians are overthrown so that they cannot recover. They carry away very much spoil and strike all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the Lord has come upon them, and they plunder all the cities, for there is much spoil in them. They also strike down the tents of herdsmen and carry away many sheep, camels, and return to Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 15: Asa's Further Reforms

The Spirit of God comes on Azariah son of Oded. He goes out to meet Asa and says to him, "Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The Lord is with you while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. For a long season Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law. But when in their trouble they turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and seek him, he is found of them." He warns that in those times there is no peace to those who go out or come in, but great vexations are upon all the inhabitants of the countries. He exhorts them, "Be strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."

When Asa hears these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he takes courage. He puts away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities he has captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He repairs the altar of the Lord that is before the porch of the Lord. He gathers all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who sojourn with them, for many from Israel join him when they see that the Lord his God is with him. They assemble at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. At that time they sacrifice to the Lord from the spoil they have brought: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. They enter into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul, and whoever will not seek the Lord God of Israel is to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. They swear unto the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets. All Judah rejoices at the oath, for they have sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire, and he is found of them. The Lord gives them rest round about. Asa removes Maachah his mother from being queen because she has made an idol in a grove; Asa cuts down her idol, crushes it, and burns it at the brook Kidron. Although the high places are not taken away out of Israel, Asa's heart is perfect all his days.

## 2 Chronicles 16: Asa's Alliance with Aram

In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasha king of Israel goes up against Judah and builds Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah. Asa takes silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and sends them to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who dwells in Damascus, saying, "There is a league between me and thee, as between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me." Ben-hadad listens to King Asa, sends the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smites Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. When Baasha hears it, he ceases building Ramah and lets his work cease. Then King Asa brings all Judah, and they carry away the stones of Ramah and its timber; he builds with them Geba and Mizpah.

At that time Hanani the seer comes to Asa king of Judah and says to him, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram and not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Aram escaped out of thine hand. Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thine hand. For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars." Asa is angry with the seer, puts him in a prison house, for he is in a rage with him because of this. Asa oppresses some of the people at the same time. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa is diseased in his feet, until his disease is exceeding great. Yet in his disease he seeks not to the Lord, but to the physicians. Asa sleeps with his fathers and dies in the forty-first year of his reign. They bury him in his own sepulchres, which he has made for himself in the City of David, and lay him in the bed filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices, and make a very great burning for him.

## 2 Chronicles 17: Jehoshaphat's Strength and Reforms

Jehoshaphat his son succeeds him as king and strengthens himself against Israel. He places forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and sets garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa has taken. The Lord is with Jehoshaphat because he walks in the first ways of his father David and does not seek Baalim, but seeks the God of his father and walks in his commandments and not after the doings of Israel. Therefore the Lord establishes the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brings to Jehoshaphat presents; he has riches and honor in abundance. His heart is lifted up in the ways of the Lord, and he removes the high places and groves out of Judah.

In the third year of his reign, he sends his princes to teach in the cities of Judah, with them Levites and priests. They teach in Judah, having the book of the law of the Lord with them, and go about through all the cities of Judah and teach the people. The fear of the Lord falls upon all the kingdoms of the lands that are around Judah, so that they do not make war against Jehoshaphat. Some of the Philistines bring Jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver; the Arabians bring him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred he goats. Jehoshaphat waxes great exceedingly; he builds in Judah castles and cities of store. He has much business in the cities of Judah, and the men of war, mighty men of valor, are in Jerusalem. The chapter concludes with a detailed list of his military forces, totaling over a million fighting men, mighty men of valor.

## 2 Chronicles 18: Jehoshaphat and Ahab at Ramoth Gilead

Jehoshaphat has riches and honor in abundance and joins affinity with Ahab by marriage. After certain years he goes down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab kills sheep and oxen for him and the people that are with him and persuades him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead. Ahab king of Israel says to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth Gilead?" He answers, "I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war." Jehoshaphat, however, says to the king of Israel, "Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord today."

The king of Israel gathers together four hundred prophets and says to them, "Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" They say, "Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand." But Jehoshaphat says, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might inquire of him?" The king of Israel answers, "There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he never prophesies good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat says, "Let not the king say so." Micaiah is summoned. At first he answers as the other prophets, telling the king to go up and prosper. But when adjured to speak only the truth in the name of the Lord, he declares that he has seen all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd, and the Lord saying, "These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace." He also relates a vision of the Lord on his throne with the host of heaven, and a lying spirit sent to entice Ahab. One of the false prophets, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, strikes Micaiah on the cheek. Ahab orders Micaiah to be put in prison and fed with bread and water of affliction until he returns in peace. Micaiah replies, "If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the Lord spoken by me," and adds, "Hearken, all ye people."

The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat go up to Ramoth Gilead. Ahab disguises himself, but Jehoshaphat wears his robes. The king of Aram has ordered his chariot commanders to fight only the king of Israel. When they see Jehoshaphat, they suppose he is the king of Israel and surround him to attack, but Jehoshaphat cries out, and the Lord helps him, and God moves them to depart from him. A certain man draws a bow at a venture and strikes the king of Israel between the joints of the harness. Ahab is propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening, and he dies at sunset.

## 2 Chronicles 19: Jehoshaphat's Judicial Reforms

Jehoshaphat king of Judah returns to his house in peace to Jerusalem. Jehu the son of Hanani the seer goes out to meet him and says to King Jehoshaphat, "Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? Therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God."

Jehoshaphat dwells at Jerusalem, and he goes out again among the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim and brings them back unto the Lord God of their fathers. He sets judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city. He says to the judges, "Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment. Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts." Moreover, in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat sets some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the fathers' houses of Israel for the judgment of the Lord and for controversies. He charges them, saying, "Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. In every cause that shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities—whether bloodshed, law, commandment, statutes, or judgments—ye shall warn them that they trespass not against the Lord." He appoints Amariah the chief priest over all matters of the Lord and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters, and the Levites as officers. He exhorts them, "Deal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the good."

## 2 Chronicles 20: Victory Over Moab and Ammon

After this, the children of Moab and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Meunites, come against Jehoshaphat to battle. A great multitude comes from beyond the sea, from Edom. Jehoshaphat fears and sets himself to seek the Lord and proclaims a fast throughout all Judah. Judah gathers themselves together to ask help of the Lord; even out of all the cities of Judah they come to seek the Lord.

Jehoshaphat stands in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court, and prays: he acknowledges God's sovereignty and faithfulness and appeals to God's justice against the invaders whom Israel had previously spared. He confesses, "We have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee." All Judah stands before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, and their children. Then the Spirit of the Lord comes upon Jahaziel the Levite, who declares, "Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's... Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you." Jehoshaphat and all Judah bow before the Lord in worship; the Levites stand up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice.

Early in the morning they go out to the wilderness of Tekoa. Jehoshaphat exhorts them, "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper." He appoints singers to praise the beauty of holiness, going out before the army, saying, "Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever." When they begin to sing and praise, the Lord sets ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir. The enemies destroy one another until none escapes. When Judah comes to the watchtower in the wilderness, they look toward the multitude and see only dead bodies fallen to the earth. They find much spoil, more than they can carry away; it takes them three days to gather it. On the fourth day they assemble in the Valley of Beracah and bless the Lord. Then they return to Jerusalem with joy, with psalteries, harps, and trumpets, to the house of the Lord. The fear of God is on all the kingdoms of those countries when they hear that the Lord has fought against the enemies of Israel. The realm of Jehoshaphat is quiet, for his God gives him rest round about. The chapter notes his reign of twenty-five years, doing that which is right in the sight of the Lord, though the high places are not removed. He later joins himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acts wickedly, to build ships, but the ships are broken and cannot go to Tarshish.

## 2 Chronicles 21: The Wicked Reign of Jehoram

Jehoshaphat rests with his fathers and is buried with them in the City of David, and Jehoram his son reigns in his stead. Jehoram's brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat, receive gifts of silver, gold, and precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, but the kingdom he gives to Jehoram, because he is the firstborn. When Jehoram is risen up to the kingdom, he strengthens himself and slays all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.

Jehoram is thirty-two years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns eight years in Jerusalem. He walks in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab, for he has the daughter of Ahab as wife. He does evil in the sight of the Lord. Yet the Lord will not destroy the house of David because of the covenant He has made with David and as He promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever. In his days Edom revolts from under the dominion of Judah and sets up a king. Jehoram goes forth with his princes and all his chariots. The Edomites surround him, but he arises by night and smites them. Yet Edom revolts from under the hand of Judah to this day. Libnah also revolts at the same time, because he has forsaken the Lord God of his fathers. He makes high places in the mountains of Judah and causes the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication and compels Judah thereto.

Jehoram receives a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying that because he has not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat and Asa, but has walked in the way of the kings of Israel and has slain his brothers who were better than he, the Lord will bring a great plague upon his people, his children, his wives, and all his goods. He himself will have great sickness by disease of his bowels, until his bowels fall out by reason of the sickness. The Lord stirs up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians near the Ethiopians. They come up into Judah, break into it, and carry away all the substance found in the king's house, his sons, and his wives, leaving him only his youngest son, Ahaziah. After all this, the Lord smites him in his bowels with an incurable disease. After two years, his bowels fall out by reason of his sickness, and he dies in great pain. His people make no burning for him like the burning of his fathers. He is buried in the City of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.

## 2 Chronicles 22: Ahaziah and Athaliah

The inhabitants of Jerusalem make Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram, king in his stead, for the band of men that comes with the Arabians has slain all the elder sons. Ahaziah is twenty-two years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name is Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. He also walks in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother is his counselor to do wickedly. He does evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab, for they are his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction.

He also walks after their counsel and goes with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Syrians wound Joram, who returns to Jezreel to be healed. Ahaziah king of Judah goes down to see Joram. God has ordained the downfall of Ahaziah by coming to Joram, for when he arrives, he goes out with Joram against Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the Lord has anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. Jehu executes judgment upon the house of Ahab and finds the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brethren that minister to Ahaziah, and slays them. He seeks Ahaziah, who is hiding in Samaria; they bring him to Jehu, who puts him to death. They bury him, for they say he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. There is none of the house of Ahaziah to keep the kingdom.

When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, sees that her son is dead, she arises and destroys all the royal seed of the house of Judah. But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, takes Joash the son of Ahaziah and steals him away from among the king's sons that are slain and hides him and his nurse in a bedchamber. Jehoshabeath, being wife of Jehoiada the priest, hides him from Athaliah so that she does not slay him. He is hidden with them in the house of God six years while Athaliah reigns over the land.

## 2 Chronicles 23: Jehoiada's Coup

In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthens himself and makes a covenant with the captains of hundreds, the nobles, and the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel. They gather the Levites out of all the cities of Judah and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they come to Jerusalem. The whole congregation makes a covenant with the king in the house of God. Jehoiada says to them, "Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the Lord has said of the sons of David." He sets out a plan for the priests and Levites to guard the king and the temple on the day of the coronation.

Jehoiada and his sons bring out the king's son and put upon him the crown and the testimony; they make him king and anoint him and say, "God save the king." When Athaliah hears the noise of the people running and praising the king, she comes to the people in the house of the Lord. She sees the king standing at his pillar at the entering in, with the princes and the trumpets by the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and sounding with trumpets, with singers and musical instruments. Athaliah rends her clothes and cries, "Treason, Treason." Jehoiada the priest commands the captains to bring her forth and slay with the sword whoever follows her, but not to kill her in the house of the Lord. So they lay hands on her, and when she comes to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slay her there.

Jehoiada makes a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the Lord's people. All the people go to the house of Baal and break it down, break his altars and images in pieces, and slay Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. Jehoiada appoints officers over the house of the Lord. He takes the captains, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land; they bring down the king from the house of the Lord, come through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. All the people of the land rejoice, and the city is quiet after they have slain Athaliah with the sword.

## 2 Chronicles 24: Joash Repairs the Temple

Joash is seven years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns forty years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest. Jehoiada takes for him two wives, and he begets sons and daughters. After this, Joash sets his heart on repairing the house of the Lord. He gathers the priests and Levites and says to them to go out to the cities of Judah and gather money to repair the house of God, from year to year, and to expedite the matter. But the Levites do not act quickly. King Joash calls Jehoiada and asks why the Levites have not brought in from Judah and Jerusalem the collection commanded by Moses for the tabernacle of witness. For the sons of Athaliah have broken up the house of God and bestowed all the dedicated things upon Baalim.

At the king's command, a chest is made and set without at the gate of the house of the Lord. A proclamation is made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God has laid upon Israel in the wilderness. All the princes and all the people rejoice and bring in, and cast into the chest, until they have made an end. When the chest is brought to the king's office, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer empty it and carry it back to its place. They do this day by day and gather money in abundance. The king and Jehoiada give it to those who do the work of the service of the house of the Lord, who hire masons and carpenters to repair the house, and also workers in iron and brass. The workmen labor, and the work is perfected by them; they set the house of God in its state and strengthen it. When they have finished, they bring the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, who use it to make vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels to minister and to offer, and spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offer burnt offerings continually all the days of Jehoiada.

Jehoiada grows old and is full of days and dies at the age of one hundred and thirty years. They bury him in the City of David among the kings, because he has done good in Israel, both toward God and his house. After the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah come and make obeisance to the king; he hearkens unto them. They forsake the house of the Lord God of their fathers and serve groves and idols, and wrath comes upon Judah and Jerusalem. The Lord sends prophets to bring them again unto the Lord, but they will not give ear. Then the Spirit of God comes upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, who stands above the people and says, "Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you." They conspire against him, and at the commandment of the king they stone him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord. Joash remembers not the kindness which Jehoiada his father has done to him, but slays his son. As Zechariah dies, he says, "The Lord look upon it, and require it."

At the end of the year, the host of Aram comes up against Joash. They come to Judah and Jerusalem, destroy all the princes of the people, and send all the spoil to the king of Damascus. Though the army of Aram comes with a small company, the Lord delivers a very great host into their hand, because Judah has forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. They execute judgment upon Joash. When they depart from him, leaving him in great diseases, his own servants conspire against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and slay him on his bed. He dies and is buried in the City of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. Amaziah his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 25: Amaziah's Reign

Amaziah is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. When the kingdom is established to him, he slays his servants who have killed the king his father. But he does not put their children to death, according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the Lord has commanded that the fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; every man shall die for his own sin.

Amaziah gathers Judah together and appoints them according to their fathers' houses, captains over thousands and over hundreds. He finds three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war. He also hires one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver. But there comes a man of God to him, saying, "O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim. But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy, for God hath power to help and to cast down." Amaziah asks, "But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of God answers, "The Lord is able to give thee much more than this." Amaziah dismisses the army that is come to him from Ephraim to go home. They are very wroth with Judah and return home in great anger. Amaziah takes courage, leads forth his people, and goes to the Valley of Salt, where he smites ten thousand of the children of Seir. He also takes another ten thousand alive, brings them to the top of a rock, and casts them down, so that they are broken in pieces.

Meanwhile, the soldiers of the army Amaziah has sent back from going with him fall upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smite three thousand and take much spoil. After Amaziah comes from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brings the gods of the children of Seir, sets them up to be his gods, bows himself before them, and burns incense unto them. Therefore the anger of the Lord burns against Amaziah, and He sends unto him a prophet who says, "Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?" As he speaks, the king says, "Art thou made of the king's counsel? Forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?" The prophet ceases but says, "I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel."

After taking counsel, Amaziah sends to challenge Jehoash king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us see one another in the face." Jehoash sends to him a parable about a thistle and a cedar, warning him not to glory in his victory over Edom and to stay at home. Amaziah, however, does not listen. Jehoash king of Israel goes up; they look one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. Judah is put to the worse before Israel, and they flee every man to his tent. Jehoash captures Amaziah king of Judah and brings him to Jerusalem, breaks down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. He takes all the gold and silver and all the vessels found in the house of God with Obed-edom and the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returns to Samaria. Amaziah lives after the death of Jehoash fifteen years. From the time that Amaziah turns away from following the Lord, they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; he flees to Lachish, but they send men after him to Lachish and kill him there. He is brought back by horses and buried with his fathers in the City of Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 26: Uzziah's Prosperity and Pride

All the people of Judah take Uzziah, who is sixteen years old, and make him king in the room of his father Amaziah. He builds Eloth and restores it to Judah after the king sleeps with his fathers. Uzziah is sixteen years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns fifty-two years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah has done. He seeks God in the days of Zechariah, who has understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he seeks the Lord, God makes him to prosper.

He goes forth and wars against the Philistines, breaks down the wall of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod, and builds cities about Ashdod and among the Philistines. God helps him against the Philistines and against the Arabians and the Meunites. The Ammonites give gifts to Uzziah, and his name spreads abroad even to the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthens himself exceedingly. Uzziah builds towers in Jerusalem and fortifies them; he builds towers in the desert and digs many wells, for he has much cattle and husbandmen, for he loves husbandry. He has a host of fighting men that go out to war by bands, according to the number of their muster by the hand of a scribe. The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor is two thousand six hundred; under their hand is an army of three hundred thousand seven thousand and five hundred. Uzziah prepares for them shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and slings. He makes in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spreads far abroad, for he is marvelously helped till he is strong.

But when he is strong, his heart is lifted up to his destruction. He transgresses against the Lord his God and goes into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense. Azariah the priest goes in after him, and with him eighty priests of the Lord that are valiant men. They withstand King Uzziah and say, "It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the priests the sons of Aaron." Uzziah is wroth, and while he has a censer in his hand to burn incense, leprosy rises up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord. Azariah and the priests look upon him, and behold, he is leprous in his forehead; they thrust him out, yea, himself hurries to go out, because the Lord has smitten him. King Uzziah is a leper unto the day of his death and dwells in a separate house, being a leper, for he is cut off from the house of the Lord. Jotham his son is over the king's house, judging the people of the land. Uzziah sleeps with his fathers; they bury him in a field of burial which belongs to the kings, for they say, "He is a leper." Jotham his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 27: Jotham's Reign

Jotham is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns sixteen years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah has done, howbeit he enters not into the temple of the Lord. The people do yet corruptly. He builds the high gate of the house of the Lord and much on the wall of Ophel. He builds cities in the mountains of Judah and in the forests builds castles and towers.

He fights also with the king of the Ammonites and prevails against them. The children of Ammon give him the same year a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much do the children of Ammon pay unto him in the second year and the third. Jotham becomes mighty because he prepares his ways before the Lord his God. He sleeps with his fathers and is buried in the City of David, and Ahaz his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 28: Ahaz's Wickedness

Ahaz, the king of Judah, is one of the most wicked kings in the nation’s history. He does not do what is right in the eyes of the Lord but walks in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even goes so far as to sacrifice his own son in the fire, following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord has driven out. He offers sacrifices and burns incense at the high places, on the hilltops, and under every spreading tree.

Therefore the Lord his God delivers him into the hands of the king of Aram. The Arameans defeat him and take many of his people as prisoners and bring them to Damascus. He is also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicts heavy casualties on him. In one day Pekah son of Remaliah kills a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah—because Judah has forsaken the Lord, the God of their ancestors. Zikri, an Ephraimite warrior, kills Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king. The men of Israel take captive two hundred thousand of their fellow Israelites—women, sons, and daughters—and also take a great deal of plunder, which they carry back to Samaria. But a prophet of the Lord named Oded goes out to meet the army returning to Samaria and rebukes them for their cruelty, urging them to send the captives back. Some leaders of Ephraim support him. The soldiers give up the captives and the plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly. Men designated by name take the captives, clothe all who are naked, provide them with sandals, food, drink, and healing balm, and transport the weak on donkeys to Jericho, the City of Palms, and then return to Samaria.

At that time King Ahaz sends to the kings of Assyria for help. The Edomites have again come and attacked Judah and carried away captives, while the Philistines have raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria comes to him, but he gives him trouble instead of help. Ahaz takes some of the things from the temple of the Lord and from the royal palace and from the officials and presents them to the king of Assyria, but that does not help him. In his time of trouble King Ahaz becomes even more unfaithful to the Lord. He offers sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who have defeated him, for he thinks, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they are his downfall and the downfall of all Israel. Ahaz gathers together the furnishings from the temple of God and cuts them in pieces. He shuts the doors of the Lord's temple and sets up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem. In every town in Judah he builds high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and arouses the anger of the Lord, the God of his ancestors. Ahaz rests with his ancestors and is buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he is not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeds him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 29: Hezekiah's Reforms Begin

Hezekiah is twenty-five years old when he becomes king, and he reigns in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father David has done. In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opens the doors of the temple of the Lord and repairs them. He brings in the priests and the Levites, assembles them on the east side, and says to them: "Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the Lord, the God of your ancestors. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary. Our parents were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the Lord our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the Lord's dwelling place and turned their backs on him. They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel. Therefore, the anger of the Lord has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn. Now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us. My sons, do not be negligent now, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him."

The Levites set to work and begin to consecrate themselves. They go in to purify the temple of the Lord, as the king has ordered, following the word of the Lord. They bring out to the courtyard everything unclean that they find in the temple of the Lord. The Levites take it and carry it out to the Kidron Valley. They begin the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reach the portico of the Lord. For eight more days they consecrate the temple itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month. Then they go in to King Hezekiah and report that they have purified the entire temple of the Lord, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles. Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathers the city officials together and goes up to the temple of the Lord. They bring seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. The king commands the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the Lord. The Levites stand with David's instruments, and the priests with trumpets. Hezekiah gives the order to sacrifice the burnt offering. As the offering begins, singing to the Lord begins also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel. The whole assembly bows in worship, while the musicians play and the trumpets sound. When the offerings are finished, the king and everyone present kneel down and worship. Hezekiah invites the people to bring sacrifices and thank offerings. The assembly brings many burnt offerings and consecrated things; there are more offerings than the priests can handle, so the Levites assist them. Thus the service of the temple of the Lord is reestablished. Hezekiah and all the people rejoice at what God has brought about for his people, because it is done so quickly.

## 2 Chronicles 30: The Great Passover

Hezekiah sends word to all Israel and Judah and also writes letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel. The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decide to celebrate the Passover in the second month, because not enough priests have consecrated themselves and the people have not assembled in Jerusalem at the regular time. A proclamation is sent throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come and keep the Passover. The couriers go from town to town through Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun, but most people scorn and mock them. Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humble themselves and come to Jerusalem.

In Judah the hand of God is on the people to give them one heart to obey the commands of the king and the officials. A very great assembly gathers in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. They remove the altars in Jerusalem and throw them into the Kidron Valley. They slaughter the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites are ashamed and consecrate themselves and bring burnt offerings to the house of the Lord. Many of the people are not ceremonially clean, so the Levites have to slaughter the Passover lambs for all who are not ceremonially clean. Though many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun have not purified themselves, yet they eat the Passover contrary to what is written. But Hezekiah prays for them, saying, "May the Lord, who is good, pardon every one that sets his heart to seek God... though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary." The Lord hears Hezekiah and heals the people.

The Israelites who are present in Jerusalem celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness, while the Levites and priests praise the Lord day by day with loud instruments. Hezekiah speaks encouragingly to all the Levites, who show good understanding of the service of the Lord. The whole assembly then resolves to keep the feast another seven days, and they keep it with gladness. Hezekiah provides the congregation with a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; the princes provide a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. Many priests consecrate themselves. There is great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon there has not been the like. The priests and Levites stand to bless the people, and their voice is heard, and their prayer comes up to heaven, God's holy dwelling place.

## 2 Chronicles 31: Religious Reforms and Organization

When all this is finished, all Israel that are present go out to the cities of Judah and break the images in pieces, cut down the groves, throw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they have utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel return to their cities, every man to his possession. Hezekiah appoints the courses of the priests and Levites after their courses, each according to his service, to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camps of the Lord. He appoints also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening offerings, and for the Sabbaths, new moons, and set feasts, as it is written in the law of the Lord. Moreover, he commands the people that dwell in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord.

As soon as the commandment comes abroad, the children of Israel bring in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; the tithe of all things they bring in abundantly. The children of Israel and Judah that dwell in the cities of Judah also bring in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which are consecrated unto the Lord their God, and lay them in heaps. In the third month they begin to lay the foundation of the heaps and finish them in the seventh month. When Hezekiah and the princes come and see the heaps, they bless the Lord and his people Israel. Hezekiah inquires concerning the heaps, and Azariah the chief priest answers that since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, they have had enough to eat and plenty left, for the Lord has blessed his people, and that which is left is this great store. Hezekiah commands to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord; they prepare them and bring in the offerings and tithes faithfully. The chapter lists those who oversee the distribution to the priests and Levites by their divisions. Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, working what is good and right and truth before the Lord his God. In every work that he begins in the service of the house of God, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he does it with all his heart and prospers.

## 2 Chronicles 32: Sennacherib's Invasion

After all that Hezekiah has so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria comes and invades Judah. He lays siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself. When Hezekiah sees that Sennacherib has come and that he intends to wage war against Jerusalem, he consults with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they help him. They gather a large group of people who block all the springs and the stream that flows through the land. "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?" they say. Then he works hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He builds another wall outside that one and reinforces the terraces of the City of David. He also makes large numbers of weapons and shields.

He appoints military officers over the people and assembles them before him in the square at the city gate and encourages them with these words: "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gain confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah says. Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces are laying siege to Lachish, he sends his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who are there: he mocks their trust in Hezekiah and in the Lord, comparing the God of Jerusalem to the idols of the nations, insisting that no god has been able to deliver any nation from his hand. His officers speak further against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah, and they call out in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem to terrify and trouble them.

King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cry out in prayer to heaven about this. And the Lord sends an angel, who annihilates all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. Sennacherib withdraws to his own land in disgrace. When he goes into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword. So the Lord saves Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib and from the hand of all others. He takes care of them on every side. Many bring offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah, and he is exalted in the sight of all nations.

In those days Hezekiah becomes ill and is at the point of death. He prays to the Lord, who answers him and gives him a miraculous sign. But Hezekiah's heart is proud and he does not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the Lord's wrath is on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. Then Hezekiah repents of the pride of his heart, as do the people of Jerusalem; therefore the Lord's wrath does not come on them during the days of Hezekiah. Hezekiah has very great riches and honor and makes treasuries for his silver and gold and precious stones, spices, shields, and all manner of pleasant jewels. He builds storehouses for the increase of grain, wine, and oil, stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds. He prospers in all his works. However, when envoys are sent from the rulers of Babylon to inquire about the miraculous sign that has occurred in the land, God leaves him to test him and to know all that is in his heart. Hezekiah rests with his ancestors and is buried on the hill where the tombs of David's descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honor him when he dies. Manasseh his son succeeds him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 33: Manasseh and Amon

Manasseh is twelve years old when he becomes king, and he reigns in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. He does evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord has driven out before the Israelites. He rebuilds the high places his father Hezekiah has demolished; he also erects altars to the Baals and makes Asherah poles. He bows down to all the starry hosts and worships them. He builds altars in the temple of the Lord, of which the Lord has said, "My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever." In both courts of the temple of the Lord, he builds altars to all the starry hosts. He sacrifices his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practices divination and witchcraft, seeks omens, and consults mediums and spiritists. He does much evil in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger. He takes the image he has made and puts it in God's temple. The Lord speaks to Manasseh and his people, but they pay no attention. So the Lord brings against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who take Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bind him with bronze shackles, and take him to Babylon.

In his distress he seeks the favor of the Lord his God and humbles himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. And when he prays to him, the Lord is moved by his entreaty and listens to his plea; so he brings him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knows that the Lord is God. Afterward he rebuilds the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also makes it much higher. He stations military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah. He gets rid of the foreign gods and removes the image from the temple of the Lord, as well as all the altars he has built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he throws them out of the city. Then he restores the altar of the Lord and sacrifices fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and tells Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel. The people, however, continue to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the Lord their God. Manasseh rests with his ancestors and is buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeds him as king.

Amon is twenty-two years old when he becomes king, and he reigns in Jerusalem for two years. He does evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Manasseh has done. Amon worships and offers sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh has made. But unlike his father Manasseh, he does not humble himself before the Lord; Amon increases his guilt. Amon's officials conspire against him and assassinate him in his palace. Then the people of the land kill all who have plotted against King Amon, and they make Josiah his son king in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 34: Josiah's Reforms

Josiah is eight years old when he becomes king, and he reigns in Jerusalem for thirty-one years. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord and follows the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left. In the eighth year of his reign, while he is still young, he begins to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he begins to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles, and idols. Under his direction the altars of the Baals are torn down; he cuts to pieces the incense altars that are above them, and smashes the Asherah poles and the idols. These he breaks to pieces and scatters over the graves of those who have sacrificed to them. He burns the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purges Judah and Jerusalem. In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them, he tears down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushes the idols to powder and cuts to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he goes back to Jerusalem.

In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sends Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the Lord his God. Hilkiah the priest finds the Book of the Law of the Lord that has been given through Moses. Hilkiah says to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord." He gives the scroll to Shaphan, who reads it and then brings it to the king. When Shaphan reads from it in the presence of the king, and the king hears the words of the Law, he tears his robes in grief. He commands Hilkiah and others to inquire of the Lord for him and for the remnant concerning the words of the book, for great is the Lord's anger poured out because their fathers have not kept the word of the Lord.

They go to Huldah the prophetess, who lives in Jerusalem, and inquire of her. She says, "This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah—because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods." But to the king of Judah, she says, "Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God, tore your robes, and wept in my presence, I have heard you. You will be gathered to your ancestors in peace, and your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring." They take her answer back to the king. Then the king calls together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. He goes up to the temple of the Lord with the people, priests, and Levites—all the people from the least to the greatest—and reads in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant. He stands by his pillar and renews the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, statutes, and decrees with all his heart and soul—and he makes all who are present in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it. Josiah removes all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites and has all who are present in Israel serve the Lord their God. As long as he lives, they do not fail to follow the Lord, the God of their ancestors.

## 2 Chronicles 35: Josiah's Passover and Death

Josiah celebrates the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb is slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month. He appoints the priests to their duties and encourages them in the service of the Lord's temple. He says to the Levites, who instruct all Israel and who have been consecrated to the Lord: "Put the holy ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel. Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon." He provides for all the lay people who are there a total of thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle—all from the king's own possessions. His officials also contribute voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. The Passover is celebrated, and the service is arranged properly. The priests splash against the altar the blood handed to them, while the Levites skin the animals. The Passover is roasted over the fire as prescribed, and the other holy offerings are cooked in pots, caldrons, and pans and served quickly to all the people. The musicians and gatekeepers perform their duties faithfully.

So at that time the entire service of the Lord is carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, as King Josiah has ordered. The Israelites who are present celebrate the Passover and observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days. The Passover has not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; none of the kings of Israel has ever celebrated such a Passover as Josiah does, with the priests, Levites, and all Judah and Israel who are present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. This Passover is celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.

After all this, when Josiah has set the temple in order, Necho king of Egypt goes up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marches out to meet him in battle. But Necho sends messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between me and thee, king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste. Forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not." Josiah, however, does not turn away from him, but disguises himself to fight with him. He does not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God but goes to fight in the plain of Megiddo. The archers shoot King Josiah, and he says to his servants, "Have me away; for I am sore wounded." They take him out of his chariot, put him in the second chariot, and bring him to Jerusalem, where he dies. He is buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourn for Josiah. Jeremiah composes laments for Josiah, and all the singing men and women speak of Josiah in their lamentations to this day.

## 2 Chronicles 36: The Fall of Judah and the Exile

The people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah and make him king in Jerusalem in place of his father. Jehoahaz is twenty-three years old when he becomes king, and he reigns in Jerusalem three months. The king of Egypt deposes him in Jerusalem, imposes on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold, and carries Jehoahaz off to Egypt.

The king of Egypt then makes Eliakim, brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah and Jerusalem, changing his name to Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim is twenty-five years old when he becomes king, and he reigns eleven years in Jerusalem. He does evil in the eyes of the Lord his God. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacks him, binds him with bronze shackles, and takes him to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar also takes to Babylon articles from the temple of the Lord and puts them in his temple there.

Jehoiachin his son succeeds him as king. Jehoiachin is eighteen years old when he becomes king, and he reigns in Jerusalem three months and ten days. He does evil in the eyes of the Lord. In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sends for him and brings him to Babylon, along with articles of value from the temple of the Lord, and makes Zedekiah, Jehoiachin's relative, king over Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah is twenty-one years old when he becomes king, and he reigns eleven years in Jerusalem. He does evil in the eyes of the Lord his God and does not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who speaks the word of the Lord. He also rebels against King Nebuchadnezzar, who has made him take an oath in God's name. He becomes stiff-necked and hardens his heart, refusing to turn to the Lord, the God of Israel.

Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people become more and more unfaithful, following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the Lord, which he has consecrated in Jerusalem. The Lord, the God of their ancestors, sends word to them through his messengers again and again, because he has compassion on his people and on his dwelling place. But they mock God's messengers, despise his words, and scoff at his prophets until the wrath of the Lord is aroused against his people and there is no remedy. He brings up against them the king of the Babylonians, who kills their young men with the sword in the sanctuary and does not spare young men or young women, the elderly or the infirm. God gives them all into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. He carries to Babylon all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the Lord's temple and the treasures of the king and his officials. They set fire to God's temple and break down the wall of Jerusalem; they burn all the palaces and destroy everything of value. He carries into exile to Babylon the remnant, who escape from the sword, and they become servants to him and his successors until the kingdom of Persia comes to power. The land enjoys its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rests, until the seventy years are completed in fulfillment of the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah.

In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moves the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in writing: "Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up."

# 2 Chronicles Summary (KJV)

## 2 Chronicles 1: Solomon's Wisdom and Wealth

Solomon, the son of David, is now firmly established in his kingdom, and the Lord his God is with him, magnifying him exceedingly. Solomon speaks to all Israel—the commanders, judges, and leaders—and the entire assembly goes with him to the high place at Gibeon, where the Tabernacle of the Lord that Moses had made in the wilderness is located. The Ark of God, however, is in Jerusalem, in the tent that David had pitched for it. At Gibeon, Solomon goes up to the bronze altar before the Lord and offers a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

That night, God appears to Solomon and says, "Ask what I shall give thee." Solomon responds with humility and wisdom. He acknowledges that God has shown great mercy to his father David and has made him king in his place. He asks God for wisdom and knowledge to lead the people, saying, "Who can judge this thy people, that is so great?" God is pleased with Solomon's request because he did not ask for wealth, possessions, honor, the death of his enemies, or even a long life. God grants him wisdom and knowledge, and He also gives him wealth, possessions, and honor such as no king before him has had and none after him will have. Solomon returns from Gibeon to Jerusalem and reigns over Israel. The chapter concludes by describing Solomon's accumulation of chariots and horses and his immense wealth, noting that silver and gold become as common in Jerusalem as stones.

## 2 Chronicles 2: Preparations for Building the Temple

Solomon determines to build a temple for the name of the Lord and a royal palace for himself. He conscripts 70,000 men to be carriers, 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hill country, and 3,600 foremen to supervise them. Solomon sends a message to Hiram (also called Huram), the king of Tyre, reminding him of the assistance he had given to David and requesting his help in this great project. Solomon asks Hiram to send him cedar, juniper, and algum logs from Lebanon, for he knows that Hiram's servants are skilled in cutting timber. He also requests that Hiram send him a skilled craftsman to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, and fabric, to work alongside the skilled workers in Judah and Jerusalem whom David had prepared.

Hiram responds with a letter praising the Lord for giving David such a wise son. He agrees to provide the timber Solomon needs, having his men cut it in Lebanon and float it by sea to Joppa, from where Solomon's men can transport it to Jerusalem. Hiram also sends a master craftsman named Huram-Abi, whose mother is from the tribe of Dan and whose father is from Tyre, skilled in all kinds of work. Solomon then takes a census of all the foreigners living in Israel, following the example of his father David, and finds there are 153,600. He assigns them to the labor force for the Temple project.

## 2 Chronicles 3: The Construction of the Temple

Solomon begins to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, the place where the Lord had appeared to his father David, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, which David had prepared. He begins construction in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. The foundation Solomon lays for building the Temple of God is sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, using the old standard of measurement. The portico at the front of the Temple is twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the building, and twenty cubits high. He overlays the inside with pure gold.

The main hall is paneled with juniper and overlaid with fine gold, decorated with palm tree and chain designs. He adorns the Temple with precious stones, and the gold he uses is gold of Parvaim. He overlays the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls, and doors of the Temple with gold, and he carves cherubim on the walls. He builds the Most Holy Place, making it a perfect square of twenty cubits by twenty cubits, and overlays it with six hundred talents of fine gold. Inside the Most Holy Place, he makes two cherubim of sculptured work and overlays them with gold. The total wingspan of the cherubim is twenty cubits, with each wing being five cubits long. He also makes the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it. In front of the Temple, he makes two pillars, each thirty-five cubits high, with capitals on top that are five cubits high. He makes chains and puts them on top of the pillars, and he makes a hundred pomegranates and attaches them to the chains. He erects the pillars in the front of the Temple, one to the south and one to the north, naming them Jakin and Boaz.

## 2 Chronicles 4: The Temple Furnishings

Solomon makes a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. He also makes the Sea, a massive circular basin cast in metal, ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference. Below the rim, figures of bulls encircle it, ten to a cubit, cast in two rows as part of the Sea itself. The Sea stands on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east, with their hindquarters toward the center. It is a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim is fashioned like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It holds three thousand baths of water.

He makes ten basins for washing and places five on the south side and five on the north, to be used for rinsing the things used for the burnt offerings. The Sea, however, is for the priests to wash in. He makes ten gold lampstands according to the specifications and places them in the Temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He makes ten tables and places them in the Temple, five on the south side and five on the north, and he makes a hundred gold sprinkling bowls. He makes the courtyard of the priests and the large court, and the doors for the court, overlaying them with bronze. He places the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner. Huram also makes the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls, completing all the work he undertakes for King Solomon for the Temple of God. The chapter provides a detailed inventory of all the bronze and gold furnishings, noting that Solomon makes so many bronze articles that the weight of the bronze is not determined. Solomon also makes all the furnishings for the Temple of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence, the lampstands and their lamps, the gold floral work and lamps and tongs, the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes, and censers, and the gold doors of the Temple.

## 2 Chronicles 5: The Ark Brought to the Temple

When all the work Solomon does for the Temple of the Lord is finished, he brings in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver, gold, and all the furnishings—and he places them in the treasuries of God's Temple. Solomon then assembles the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes in Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Lord's Covenant from Zion, the City of David. All the Israelites come together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month. When all the elders of Israel arrive, the Levites take up the Ark, and they bring up the Ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carry them up.

King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that has gathered about him are before the Ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they cannot be recorded or counted. The priests then bring the Ark of the Lord's Covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the Temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the Ark and cover the Ark and its carrying poles. The poles are so long that their ends can be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside. There is nothing in the Ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. When the priests withdraw from the Holy Place, all the priests who are there have consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions. All the Levites who are musicians stand on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. The trumpeters and musicians join in unison to give praise and thanks to the Lord, and as they raise their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and other instruments in praise to the Lord, singing, "He is good; his love endures forever," the Temple of the Lord is filled with a cloud, and the priests cannot perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord fills the Temple of God.

## 2 Chronicles 6: Solomon's Prayer of Dedication

Solomon then addresses the assembly, saying, "The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud; I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever." He turns around and blesses the whole assembly of Israel while they are standing there. He praises the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hands has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to David. He recounts how David had desired to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, but God had told him that his son would be the one to build it. Solomon declares that the Lord has kept the promise he made, for he has succeeded David and has built the temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and he has placed the Ark in it, in which is the covenant of the Lord.

Solomon then stands before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spreads out his hands. He has made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high and has placed it in the center of the outer court. He stands on it, kneels down before the whole assembly, spreads out his hands toward heaven, and prays. His prayer is a magnificent expression of faith and intercession. He acknowledges that the Lord is the God of Israel and that there is no God like Him in heaven or on earth, who keeps His covenant of love with His servants who continue wholeheartedly in His way. He acknowledges that even the highest heavens cannot contain God, much less this temple he has built. Yet he asks that God's eyes may be open toward this temple day and night and that He would hear the prayers His people pray toward this place. He then offers a series of specific petitions, asking God to hear and forgive when people sin, when they are defeated by enemies, when there is drought or famine or plague, when foreigners come to pray, when the people go to war, and when they are taken captive to a foreign land. He concludes by asking the Lord to arise and come to His resting place, along with the Ark of His might, and to let His priests be clothed with salvation and His faithful people rejoice in His goodness.

## 2 Chronicles 7: God's Response and Warning

When Solomon finishes praying, fire comes down from heaven and consumes the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord fills the Temple. The priests cannot enter the Temple of the Lord because the glory of the Lord fills it. When all the Israelites see the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the Temple, they kneel on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worship and give thanks to the Lord, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever." Then the king and all the people offer sacrifices before the Lord. King Solomon offers a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicate the Temple of God. The priests take their positions, as do the Levites with the Lord's musical instruments, and they play music to accompany the singing, "His love endures forever." The festival lasts for seven days, and then they observe the dedication of the altar for seven more days. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sends the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the Lord has done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.

That night, the Lord appears to Solomon and says to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices." God then gives both a promise and a warning. He promises that if He shuts up the heavens so that there is no rain, or commands locusts to devour the land, or sends a plague among His people, and if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray and seek His face and turn from their wicked ways, then He will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. His eyes will be open and His ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. However, God also gives a stern warning: if Solomon or his descendants turn away and forsake the decrees and commands He has given them and go off to serve other gods and worship them, then He will uproot Israel from His land, reject this temple, and make Israel a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.

## 2 Chronicles 8: Solomon's Other Achievements

At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon builds the Temple of the Lord and his own palace, Solomon rebuilds the villages that Hiram has given him and settles Israelites in them. Solomon then goes to Hamath Zobah and captures it. He also builds up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he has built in Hamath. He rebuilds Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars, as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses. He builds whatever he desires to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the territory he rules.

There are still people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—people who are not Israelites. Solomon conscripts their descendants who remain in the land, whom the Israelites have not destroyed, to serve as slave laborers, as they still are today. But Solomon does not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they are his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers. They are also King Solomon's chief officials—two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men. Solomon brings Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he has built for her, for he says, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the Lord has entered are holy." Solomon then sacrifices burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar he has built in front of the portico. He follows the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three annual festivals. He appoints the divisions of the priests for their duties and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appoints the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates. Solomon also builds a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, and Hiram sends his servants, experienced sailors, to serve with Solomon's men. They sail to Ophir and bring back 450 talents of gold, which they deliver to King Solomon.

## 2 Chronicles 9: The Queen of Sheba and Solomon's Splendor

When the queen of Sheba hears of Solomon's fame, she comes to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrives with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones. She comes to Solomon and talks with him about all that she has on her mind. Solomon answers all her questions; nothing is too hard for him to explain to her. When the queen of Sheba sees the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he has built, the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes, and the burnt offerings he makes at the temple of the Lord, she is overwhelmed.

She says to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard." She praises the happiness of his people and his officials who continually stand before him and hear his wisdom. She praises the Lord his God, who has delighted in him and placed him on his throne as king to rule for the Lord. She gives the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. King Solomon gives the queen of Sheba all she desires and asks for, more than she has brought to him. Then she and her attendants return to her own country. The chapter continues with a detailed description of Solomon's wealth, noting that the weight of the gold that comes to Solomon yearly is 666 talents, not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. He makes two hundred large shields of hammered gold and three hundred small shields of hammered gold. He makes a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with gold. The throne has six steps, a footstool of gold, armrests, and two lions standing beside the armrests, with twelve lions standing on the six steps. Nothing like it has ever been made for any other kingdom. All King Solomon's goblets are gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon are pure gold. Silver is considered of little value in Solomon's day. Solomon's wealth and wisdom exceed those of all the other kings of the earth, and the whole world seeks audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God has put in his heart. Solomon reigns in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. Then he rests with his ancestors and is buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son succeeds him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 10: The Kingdom Divides

Rehoboam goes to Shechem, for all Israel has gone there to make him king. When Jeroboam son of Nebat hears of this (he is in Egypt, where he has fled from King Solomon), he returns from Egypt. The people send for him, and Jeroboam and all Israel go to Rehoboam and say to him, "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you." Rehoboam answers, "Come back to me in three days." So the people go away.

King Rehoboam consults the elders who have served his father Solomon during his lifetime, asking, "How would you advise me to answer these people?" They reply, "If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants." But Rehoboam rejects the advice the elders give him and consults the young men who have grown up with him and are serving him. He asks them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?" The young men who have grown up with him reply, "The people have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.' Now tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'" Three days later, Jeroboam and all the people return to Rehoboam, and the king answers them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders, he follows the advice of the young men. When all Israel sees that the king refuses to listen to them, they answer the king: "What share do we have in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David, see to your own house." So all Israel goes to their tents. Rehoboam sends out Hadoram, who is in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stone him to death. King Rehoboam manages to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. So Israel rebels against the house of David to this day.

## 2 Chronicles 11: Rehoboam Strengthens Judah

When Rehoboam arrives in Jerusalem, he musters Judah and Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam. But the word of the Lord comes to Shemaiah the man of God: "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 'This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your relatives. Return home, every one of you, for this thing is from me.'" So they obey the words of the Lord and turn back from going against Jeroboam.

Rehoboam lives in Jerusalem and builds up towns for defense in Judah, including Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. He fortifies these strongholds and appoints commanders over them, putting supplies of food, oil, and wine in them. He puts shields and spears in all the cities and makes them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin are his. The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel side with him, for Jeroboam and his sons have rejected them as priests of the Lord, appointing his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he has made. Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the Lord, the God of Israel, follow the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors. They strengthen the kingdom of Judah and support Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, walking in the way of David and Solomon during that time. Rehoboam takes as wife Mahalath, daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, daughter of Eliab son of Jesse, and she bears him sons. He then takes Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bears him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. Rehoboam loves Maakah more than any of his other wives and concubines. He has eighteen wives and sixty concubines and fathers twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Rehoboam appoints Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king. He acts wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin and to all the fortified cities. He provides them with abundant provisions and seeks many wives for them.

## 2 Chronicles 12: Shishak's Invasion

After Rehoboam's position as king is established and he has become strong, he and all Israel with him abandon the law of the Lord. Because they have been unfaithful to the Lord, Shishak king of Egypt attacks Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam. With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites that come with him from Egypt, he captures the fortified cities of Judah and comes as far as Jerusalem.

Then the prophet Shemaiah comes to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who have assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he says to them, "This is what the Lord says: 'You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'" The leaders of Israel and the king humble themselves and say, "The Lord is righteous." When the Lord sees that they have humbled themselves, the word of the Lord comes to Shemaiah: "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will grant them some deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak. They will, however, become his subjects, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands." Shishak king of Egypt attacks Jerusalem and carries off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. He takes everything, including the gold shields Solomon has made. So King Rehoboam makes bronze shields to replace them and commits them to the care of the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. Whenever the king goes to the Lord's temple, the guards bear them and afterward return them to the guardroom. Rehoboam strengthens himself in Jerusalem and reigns. He is forty-one years old when he becomes king, and he reigns seventeen years in Jerusalem. He does evil because he does not set his heart to seek the Lord. Rehoboam rests with his ancestors and is buried in the City of David, and Abijah his son succeeds him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 13: Abijah's War with Jeroboam

In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah becomes king of Judah, and he reigns in Jerusalem for three years. There is war between Abijah and Jeroboam. Abijah goes into battle with an army of four hundred thousand chosen men, and Jeroboam draws up in battle array against him eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty men of valor. Abijah stands on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and addresses Jeroboam and all Israel. He delivers a powerful speech, reminding them that the Lord, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt. He accuses Jeroboam of rebelling against his master and of driving out the priests of the Lord and the Levites, appointing his own priests for the high places, just as the peoples of other lands do. He declares that Judah has not forsaken the Lord, that the priests who serve the Lord are sons of Aaron, and that the Levites assist them. He warns them, "Do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper."

Despite this speech, Jeroboam has sent an ambush to come from the rear, so that while he is in front of Judah, the ambush is behind them. Judah turns, and behold, the battle is both in front of and behind them. They cry to the Lord, and the priests blow the trumpets. The men of Judah give a shout, and as they shout, God smites Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. The men of Israel flee before Judah, and God delivers them into their hand. Abijah and his people slay them with a great slaughter, so that five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fall slain. Thus the children of Israel are subdued at that time, and the children of Judah prevail because they rely on the Lord, the God of their fathers. Abijah pursues Jeroboam and takes from him several cities, including Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. Jeroboam does not recover strength in the days of Abijah, and the Lord strikes him, and he dies. But Abijah grows mighty, takes fourteen wives, and fathers twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.

## 2 Chronicles 14: Asa's Reforms and Victory

Abijah rests with his fathers and is buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeds him as king, and in his days the land has rest for ten years. Asa does what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God. He removes the foreign altars and the high places, breaks down the sacred pillars, and cuts down the Asherah poles. He commands Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment. He also removes the high places and incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom is at rest under him. He builds fortified cities in Judah, for the land has rest, and there is no war during those years because the Lord gives him rest.

Asa says to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the Lord our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side." So they build and prosper. Asa has an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin bearing shields and drawing bows. All these are mighty men of valor. Zerah the Ethiopian comes out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots and comes as far as Mareshah. Asa goes out to meet him, and they draw up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. Then Asa calls to the Lord his God and says, "Lord, there is none besides thee to help between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Lord our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee." So the Lord smites the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians flee. Asa and the people pursue them to Gerar, and the Ethiopians are overthrown so that they cannot recover. They carry away very much spoil and strike all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the Lord has come upon them, and they plunder all the cities, for there is much spoil in them. They also strike down the tents of herdsmen and carry away many sheep, camels, and return to Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 15: Asa's Further Reforms

The Spirit of God comes on Azariah son of Oded. He goes out to meet Asa and says to him, "Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The Lord is with you while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. For a long season Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law. But when in their trouble they turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and seek him, he is found of them." He warns that in those times there is no peace to those who go out or come in, but great vexations are upon all the inhabitants of the countries. He exhorts them, "Be strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."

When Asa hears these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he takes courage. He puts away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities he has captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He repairs the altar of the Lord that is before the porch of the Lord. He gathers all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who sojourn with them, for many from Israel join him when they see that the Lord his God is with him. They assemble at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. At that time they sacrifice to the Lord from the spoil they have brought: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. They enter into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul, and whoever will not seek the Lord God of Israel is to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. They swear unto the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets. All Judah rejoices at the oath, for they have sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire, and he is found of them. The Lord gives them rest round about. Asa removes Maachah his mother from being queen because she has made an idol in a grove; Asa cuts down her idol, crushes it, and burns it at the brook Kidron. Although the high places are not taken away out of Israel, Asa's heart is perfect all his days.

## 2 Chronicles 16: Asa's Alliance with Aram

In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasha king of Israel goes up against Judah and builds Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah. Asa takes silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and sends them to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who dwells in Damascus, saying, "There is a league between me and thee, as between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me." Ben-hadad listens to King Asa, sends the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smites Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. When Baasha hears it, he ceases building Ramah and lets his work cease. Then King Asa brings all Judah, and they carry away the stones of Ramah and its timber; he builds with them Geba and Mizpah.

At that time Hanani the seer comes to Asa king of Judah and says to him, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram and not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Aram escaped out of thine hand. Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thine hand. For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars." Asa is angry with the seer, puts him in a prison house, for he is in a rage with him because of this. Asa oppresses some of the people at the same time. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa is diseased in his feet, until his disease is exceeding great. Yet in his disease he seeks not to the Lord, but to the physicians. Asa sleeps with his fathers and dies in the forty-first year of his reign. They bury him in his own sepulchres, which he has made for himself in the City of David, and lay him in the bed filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices, and make a very great burning for him.

## 2 Chronicles 17: Jehoshaphat's Strength and Reforms

Jehoshaphat his son succeeds him as king and strengthens himself against Israel. He places forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and sets garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa has taken. The Lord is with Jehoshaphat because he walks in the first ways of his father David and does not seek Baalim, but seeks the God of his father and walks in his commandments and not after the doings of Israel. Therefore the Lord establishes the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brings to Jehoshaphat presents; he has riches and honor in abundance. His heart is lifted up in the ways of the Lord, and he removes the high places and groves out of Judah.

In the third year of his reign, he sends his princes to teach in the cities of Judah, with them Levites and priests. They teach in Judah, having the book of the law of the Lord with them, and go about through all the cities of Judah and teach the people. The fear of the Lord falls upon all the kingdoms of the lands that are around Judah, so that they do not make war against Jehoshaphat. Some of the Philistines bring Jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver; the Arabians bring him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred he goats. Jehoshaphat waxes great exceedingly; he builds in Judah castles and cities of store. He has much business in the cities of Judah, and the men of war, mighty men of valor, are in Jerusalem. The chapter concludes with a detailed list of his military forces, totaling over a million fighting men, mighty men of valor.

## 2 Chronicles 18: Jehoshaphat and Ahab at Ramoth Gilead

Jehoshaphat has riches and honor in abundance and joins affinity with Ahab by marriage. After certain years he goes down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab kills sheep and oxen for him and the people that are with him and persuades him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead. Ahab king of Israel says to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth Gilead?" He answers, "I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war." Jehoshaphat, however, says to the king of Israel, "Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord today."

The king of Israel gathers together four hundred prophets and says to them, "Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" They say, "Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand." But Jehoshaphat says, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might inquire of him?" The king of Israel answers, "There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he never prophesies good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat says, "Let not the king say so." Micaiah is summoned. At first he answers as the other prophets, telling the king to go up and prosper. But when adjured to speak only the truth in the name of the Lord, he declares that he has seen all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd, and the Lord saying, "These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace." He also relates a vision of the Lord on his throne with the host of heaven, and a lying spirit sent to entice Ahab. One of the false prophets, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, strikes Micaiah on the cheek. Ahab orders Micaiah to be put in prison and fed with bread and water of affliction until he returns in peace. Micaiah replies, "If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the Lord spoken by me," and adds, "Hearken, all ye people."

The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat go up to Ramoth Gilead. Ahab disguises himself, but Jehoshaphat wears his robes. The king of Aram has ordered his chariot commanders to fight only the king of Israel. When they see Jehoshaphat, they suppose he is the king of Israel and surround him to attack, but Jehoshaphat cries out, and the Lord helps him, and God moves them to depart from him. A certain man draws a bow at a venture and strikes the king of Israel between the joints of the harness. Ahab is propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening, and he dies at sunset.

## 2 Chronicles 19: Jehoshaphat's Judicial Reforms

Jehoshaphat king of Judah returns to his house in peace to Jerusalem. Jehu the son of Hanani the seer goes out to meet him and says to King Jehoshaphat, "Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? Therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God."

Jehoshaphat dwells at Jerusalem, and he goes out again among the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim and brings them back unto the Lord God of their fathers. He sets judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city. He says to the judges, "Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment. Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts." Moreover, in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat sets some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the fathers' houses of Israel for the judgment of the Lord and for controversies. He charges them, saying, "Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. In every cause that shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities... ye shall warn them that they trespass not against the Lord, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass." He appoints Amariah the chief priest over all matters of the Lord and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters, and the Levites as officers. He exhorts them, "Deal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the good."

## 2 Chronicles 20: Victory Over Moab and Ammon

After this, the children of Moab and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Meunites, come against Jehoshaphat to battle. A great multitude comes from beyond the sea, from Edom. Jehoshaphat fears and sets himself to seek the Lord and proclaims a fast throughout all Judah. Judah gathers themselves together to ask help of the Lord; even out of all the cities of Judah they come to seek the Lord.

Jehoshaphat stands in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court, and prays: he acknowledges God's sovereignty and faithfulness, recalls how God gave the land to Abraham's descendants, and appeals to God's justice against the invaders whom Israel had previously spared. He confesses, "We have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee." All Judah stands before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, and their children. Then the Spirit of the Lord comes upon Jahaziel the Levite, who declares, "Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's... Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you." Jehoshaphat and all Judah bow before the Lord in worship; the Levites stand up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice.

Early in the morning they go out to the wilderness of Tekoa. Jehoshaphat exhorts them, "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper." He appoints singers to praise the beauty of holiness, going out before the army, saying, "Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever." When they begin to sing and praise, the Lord sets ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir. The enemies destroy one another until none escapes. When Judah comes to the watchtower in the wilderness, they look toward the multitude and see only dead bodies fallen to the earth. They find much spoil, more than they can carry away; it takes them three days to gather it. On the fourth day they assemble in the Valley of Beracah and bless the Lord. Then they return to Jerusalem with joy, with psalteries, harps, and trumpets, to the house of the Lord. The fear of God is on all the kingdoms of those countries when they hear that the Lord has fought against the enemies of Israel. The realm of Jehoshaphat is quiet, for his God gives him rest round about. The chapter notes his reign of twenty-five years, doing that which is right in the sight of the Lord, though the high places are not removed. He later joins himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acts wickedly, to build ships, but the ships are broken and cannot go to Tarshish.

## 2 Chronicles 21: The Wicked Reign of Jehoram

Jehoshaphat rests with his fathers and is buried with them in the City of David, and Jehoram his son reigns in his stead. Jehoram has brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat, whom their father has given great gifts of silver, gold, and precious things, with fenced cities in Judah. But the kingdom he gives to Jehoram, because he is the firstborn. When Jehoram is risen up to the kingdom, he strengthens himself and slays all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.

Jehoram is thirty-two years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns eight years in Jerusalem. He walks in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab, for he has the daughter of Ahab as wife. He does evil in the sight of the Lord. Yet the Lord will not destroy the house of David because of the covenant He has made with David and as He promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever. In his days Edom revolts from under the dominion of Judah and sets up a king. Jehoram goes forth with his princes and all his chariots. The Edomites surround him, but he arises by night and smites them. Yet Edom revolts from under the hand of Judah to this day. Libnah also revolts at the same time, because he has forsaken the Lord God of his fathers. He makes high places in the mountains of Judah and causes the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication and compels Judah thereto.

Jehoram receives a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying that because he has not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat and Asa, but has walked in the way of the kings of Israel and has slain his brothers who were better than he, the Lord will bring a great plague upon his people, his children, his wives, and all his goods. He himself will have great sickness by disease of his bowels, until his bowels fall out by reason of the sickness. The Lord stirs up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians near the Ethiopians. They come up into Judah, break into it, and carry away all the substance found in the king's house, his sons, and his wives, so that there is never a son left him save Jehoahaz, the youngest. After all this, the Lord smites him in his bowels with an incurable disease. After two years, his bowels fall out by reason of his sickness, and he dies in great pain. His people make no burning for him like the burning of his fathers. He is buried in the City of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.

## 2 Chronicles 22: Ahaziah and Athaliah

The inhabitants of Jerusalem make Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram, king in his stead, for the band of men that comes with the Arabians has slain all the elder sons. Ahaziah is twenty-two years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name is Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. He walks in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother is his counselor to do wickedly. He does evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab, for they are his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction.

He also walks after their counsel and goes with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Syrians wound Joram, who returns to Jezreel to be healed. Ahaziah king of Judah goes down to see Joram. God has ordained the downfall of Ahaziah by coming to Joram, for when he arrives, he goes out with Joram against Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the Lord has anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. Jehu executes judgment upon the house of Ahab and finds the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brethren that minister to Ahaziah, and slays them. He seeks Ahaziah, who is hiding in Samaria; they bring him to Jehu, who puts him to death. They bury him, for they say he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. There is none of the house of Ahaziah to keep the kingdom.

When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, sees that her son is dead, she arises and destroys all the royal seed of the house of Judah. But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, takes Joash the son of Ahaziah and steals him away from among the king's sons that are slain and hides him and his nurse in a bedchamber. Jehoshabeath, being wife of Jehoiada the priest, hides him from Athaliah so that she does not slay him. He is hidden with them in the house of God six years while Athaliah reigns over the land.

## 2 Chronicles 23: Jehoiada's Coup

In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthens himself and makes a covenant with the captains of hundreds, the nobles, and the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel. They gather the Levites out of all the cities of Judah and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they come to Jerusalem. The whole congregation makes a covenant with the king in the house of God. Jehoiada says to them, "Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the Lord has said of the sons of David." He sets out a plan for the priests and Levites to guard the king and the temple on the day of the coronation.

Jehoiada and his sons bring out the king's son and put upon him the crown and the testimony; they make him king and anoint him and say, "God save the king." When Athaliah hears the noise of the people running and praising the king, she comes to the people in the house of the Lord. She sees the king standing at his pillar at the entering in, with the princes and the trumpets by the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and sounding with trumpets, with singers and musical instruments. Athaliah rends her clothes and cries, "Treason, Treason." Jehoiada the priest commands the captains to bring her forth and slay with the sword whoever follows her, but not to kill her in the house of the Lord. So they lay hands on her, and when she comes to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slay her there.

Jehoiada makes a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the Lord's people. All the people go to the house of Baal and break it down, break his altars and images in pieces, and slay Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. Jehoiada appoints officers over the house of the Lord. He takes the captains, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land; they bring down the king from the house of the Lord, come through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. All the people of the land rejoice, and the city is quiet after they have slain Athaliah with the sword.

## 2 Chronicles 24: Joash Repairs the Temple

Joash is seven years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns forty years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest. Jehoiada takes for him two wives, and he begets sons and daughters. After this, Joash sets his heart on repairing the house of the Lord. He gathers the priests and Levites and says to them to go out to the cities of Judah and gather money to repair the house of God, from year to year, and to expedite the matter. But the Levites do not act quickly. King Joash calls Jehoiada and asks why the Levites have not brought in from Judah and Jerusalem the collection commanded by Moses for the tabernacle of witness. For the sons of Athaliah have broken up the house of God and bestowed all the dedicated things upon Baalim.

At the king's command, a chest is made and set without at the gate of the house of the Lord. A proclamation is made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God has laid upon Israel in the wilderness. All the princes and all the people rejoice and bring in, and cast into the chest, until they have made an end. When the chest is brought to the king's office, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer empty it and carry it back to its place. They do this day by day and gather money in abundance. The king and Jehoiada give it to those who do the work of the service of the house of the Lord, who hire masons and carpenters to repair the house, and also workers in iron and brass. The workmen labor, and the work is perfected by them; they set the house of God in its state and strengthen it. When they have finished, they bring the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, who use it to make vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels to minister and to offer, and spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offer burnt offerings continually all the days of Jehoiada.

Jehoiada grows old and is full of days and dies at the age of one hundred and thirty years. They bury him in the City of David among the kings, because he has done good in Israel, both toward God and his house. After the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah come and make obeisance to the king; he hearkens unto them. They forsake the house of the Lord God of their fathers and serve groves and idols, and wrath comes upon Judah and Jerusalem. The Lord sends prophets to bring them again unto the Lord, but they will not give ear. Then the Spirit of God comes upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, who stands above the people and says, "Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you." They conspire against him, and at the commandment of the king they stone him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord. Joash remembers not the kindness which Jehoiada his father has done to him, but slays his son. As Zechariah dies, he says, "The Lord look upon it, and require it."

At the end of the year, the host of Aram comes up against Joash. They come to Judah and Jerusalem, destroy all the princes of the people, and send all the spoil to the king of Damascus. Though the army of Aram comes with a small company, the Lord delivers a very great host into their hand, because Judah has forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. They execute judgment upon Joash. When they depart from him, leaving him in great diseases, his own servants conspire against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and slay him on his bed. He dies and is buried in the City of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. Amaziah his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 25: Amaziah's Reign

Amaziah is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. When the kingdom is established to him, he slays his servants who have killed the king his father. But he does not put their children to death, according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the Lord has commanded that the fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; every man shall die for his own sin.

Amaziah gathers Judah together and appoints them according to their fathers' houses, captains over thousands and over hundreds. He finds three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war. He also hires one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver. But there comes a man of God to him, saying, "O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim. But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy; for God hath power to help and to cast down." Amaziah asks, "But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of God answers, "The Lord is able to give thee much more than this." Amaziah dismisses the army that is come to him from Ephraim to go home. They are very wroth with Judah and return home in great anger. Amaziah takes courage, leads forth his people, and goes to the Valley of Salt, where he smites ten thousand of the children of Seir. He also takes another ten thousand alive, brings them to the top of a rock, and casts them down, so that they are broken in pieces.

Meanwhile, the soldiers of the army Amaziah has sent back from going with him fall upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smite three thousand and take much spoil. After Amaziah comes from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brings the gods of the children of Seir, sets them up to be his gods, bows himself before them, and burns incense unto them. Therefore the anger of the Lord burns against Amaziah, and He sends unto him a prophet who says, "Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?" As he speaks, the king says, "Art thou made of the king's counsel? Forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?" The prophet ceases but says, "I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel."

After taking counsel, Amaziah sends to challenge Jehoash king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us see one another in the face." Jehoash sends to him a parable about a thistle and a cedar, warning him not to glory in his victory over Edom and to stay at home. Amaziah will not hear, for it comes of God that he might be delivered into the hand of his enemies. Jehoash king of Israel goes up; they look one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. Judah is put to the worse before Israel, and they flee every man to his tent. Jehoash captures Amaziah king of Judah and brings him to Jerusalem, breaks down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. He takes all the gold and silver and all the vessels found in the house of God with Obed-edom and the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returns to Samaria. Amaziah lives after the death of Jehoash fifteen years. From the time that Amaziah turns away from following the Lord, they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; he flees to Lachish, but they send to Lachish after him and slay him there. They bring him upon horses and bury him with his fathers in the City of Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 26: Uzziah's Prosperity and Pride

All the people of Judah take Uzziah, who is sixteen years old, and make him king in the room of his father Amaziah. He builds Eloth and restores it to Judah after the king sleeps with his fathers. Uzziah is sixteen years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns fifty-two years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah has done. He seeks God in the days of Zechariah, who has understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he seeks the Lord, God makes him to prosper.

He goes forth and wars against the Philistines, breaks down the wall of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod, and builds cities about Ashdod and among the Philistines. God helps him against the Philistines and against the Arabians and the Meunites. The Ammonites give gifts to Uzziah, and his name spreads abroad even to the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthens himself exceedingly. Uzziah builds towers in Jerusalem and fortifies them; he builds towers in the desert and digs many wells, for he has much cattle and husbandmen, for he loves husbandry. He has a host of fighting men that go out to war by bands, according to the number of their muster by the hand of a scribe. The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor is two thousand six hundred; under their hand is an army of three hundred thousand seven thousand and five hundred. Uzziah prepares for them shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and slings. He makes in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spreads far abroad, for he is marvelously helped till he is strong.

But when he is strong, his heart is lifted up to his destruction. He transgresses against the Lord his God and goes into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense. Azariah the priest goes in after him, and with him eighty priests of the Lord that are valiant men. They withstand King Uzziah and say, "It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the priests the sons of Aaron." Uzziah is wroth, and while he has a censer in his hand to burn incense, leprosy rises up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord. Azariah and the priests look upon him, and behold, he is leprous in his forehead; they thrust him out, yea, himself hurries to go out, because the Lord has smitten him. King Uzziah is a leper unto the day of his death and dwells in a separate house, being a leper, for he is cut off from the house of the Lord. Jotham his son is over the king's house, judging the people of the land. Uzziah sleeps with his fathers; they bury him in a field of burial which belongs to the kings, for they say, "He is a leper." Jotham his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 27: Jotham's Reign

Jotham is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns sixteen years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah has done, howbeit he enters not into the temple of the Lord. The people do yet corruptly. He builds the high gate of the house of the Lord and much on the wall of Ophel. He builds cities in the mountains of Judah and in the forests builds castles and towers.

He fights also with the king of the Ammonites and prevails against them. The children of Ammon give him the same year a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much do the children of Ammon pay unto him in the second year and the third. Jotham becomes mighty because he prepares his ways before the Lord his God. He sleeps with his fathers and is buried in the City of David, and Ahaz his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 28: Ahaz's Wickedness

Ahaz is twenty years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns sixteen years in Jerusalem. He does not that which is right in the sight of the Lord as his father David has done. He walks in the ways of the kings of Israel and makes molten images for Baalim. Moreover, he burns incense in the Valley of the son of Hinnom and burns his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord has cast out. He sacrifices and burns incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.

Therefore the Lord his God delivers him into the hand of the king of Aram. They smite him and carry away a great multitude captives and bring them to Damascus. He is also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smites him with a great slaughter. Pekah son of Remaliah slays in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because they have forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slays Maaseiah the king's son and others close to the king. The children of Israel carry away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and take much spoil and bring the spoil to Samaria. But a prophet of the Lord named Oded stands before the host and rebukes them, declaring that though the Lord is angry with Judah, they have slain them with a rage that reaches unto heaven and now think to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as bondmen and bondwomen. He urges them to send the captives back. Certain chiefs of the Ephraimites support him. The armed men leave the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. The men designated by name rise and take the captives, clothe all that are naked, give them shoes, food, drink, and anoint them, carry all the feeble on donkeys, and bring them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees, and then return to Samaria.

At that time King Ahaz sends to the kings of Assyria to help him. For again the Edomites have come and smitten Judah and carry away captives; the Philistines have invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of Judah and dwell there. The Lord brings Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he makes Judah naked and transgresses sore against the Lord. Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria comes unto him and distresses him, but strengthens him not. Ahaz takes away a portion out of the house of the Lord, out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gives it unto the king of Assyria, but it helps him not. In the time of his distress, he trespasses yet more against the Lord—this is that king Ahaz. He sacrifices unto the gods of Damascus that smite him, saying, "Because the gods of the kings of Aram help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me." But they are the ruin of him and of all Israel. Ahaz gathers together the vessels of the house of God, cuts them in pieces, shuts up the doors of the house of the Lord, and makes altars in every corner of Jerusalem. In every several city of Judah he makes high places to burn incense unto other gods and provokes to anger the Lord God of his fathers. Ahaz sleeps with his fathers, and they bury him in the city, but they do not bring him into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel. Hezekiah his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 29: Hezekiah's Reforms Begin

Hezekiah is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father has done. In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opens the doors of the house of the Lord and repairs them. He brings in the priests and the Levites, gathers them into the east street, and says to them, "Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place." He recounts how their fathers have trespassed, done evil, and turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, shut up the doors, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings. Therefore the wrath of the Lord has been upon Judah and Jerusalem. He declares his intent to make a covenant with the Lord that His fierce wrath may turn away. He exhorts the Levites not to be negligent, for the Lord has chosen them to stand before Him.

The Levites arise and gather their brethren, sanctify themselves, and go in to cleanse the house of the Lord. The priests go into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse it, bringing out all the uncleanness that they find and casting it into the brook Kidron. They begin on the first day of the first month and finish on the sixteenth day. Then they come to King Hezekiah and say that they have cleansed all the house of the Lord, the altar, the table, and all the vessels. Early the next morning, Hezekiah gathers the rulers of the city and goes up to the house of the Lord. They bring seven bullocks, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. The priests kill the animals and sprinkle the blood on the altar. Hezekiah commands that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel. When the burnt offering begins, the song of the Lord begins also, with the trumpets and instruments of David king of Israel. All the congregation worships, the singers sing, and the trumpeters sound, until the burnt offering is finished. Hezekiah and all that are present bow and worship. Hezekiah and the princes command the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. They sing praises with gladness and bow their heads and worship. Hezekiah invites the people to bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the Lord. The assembly brings many burnt offerings and consecrated things. There are too few priests to flay all the burnt offerings, so their brethren the Levites help them until the work is ended. Thus the service of the house of the Lord is set in order. Hezekiah rejoices, and all the people, that God has prepared the people, for the thing is done suddenly.

## 2 Chronicles 30: The Great Passover

Hezekiah sends to all Israel and Judah and writes letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel. The king and his princes and all the congregation agree to keep the Passover in the second month because they cannot keep it at the regular time, for the priests have not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither have the people gathered to Jerusalem. The thing seems right to the king and to all the congregation. They establish a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem.

The posts go with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, with the message: "Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped... be not like your fathers... which trespassed against the Lord... but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary." Some laugh them to scorn and mock them; nevertheless divers from Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun humble themselves and come to Jerusalem. Also in Judah the hand of God is to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes. A very great congregation assembles at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month. They arise and take away the altars in Jerusalem and cast them into the brook Kidron. They kill the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites are ashamed and sanctify themselves and bring burnt offerings to the house of the Lord. Many of the people are not cleansed, yet they eat the Passover otherwise than it is written. Hezekiah prays for them, saying, "The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek God... though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary." The Lord hearkens to Hezekiah and heals the people.

The children of Israel present keep the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and priests praise the Lord day by day. Hezekiah speaks comfortably unto all the Levites that teach the good knowledge of the Lord. The whole assembly takes counsel to keep other seven days, and they keep another seven days with gladness. Hezekiah gives to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; the princes give a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. A great many priests sanctify themselves. There is great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon there has not been the like. The priests and the Levites arise and bless the people, and their voice is heard, and their prayer comes up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.

## 2 Chronicles 31: Religious Reforms and Organization

When all this is finished, all Israel that are present go out to the cities of Judah and break the images in pieces, cut down the groves, throw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they have utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel return to their cities, every man to his possession. Hezekiah appoints the courses of the priests and Levites after their courses, each according to his service, to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camps of the Lord. He appoints also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening offerings, and for the Sabbaths, new moons, and set feasts, as it is written in the law of the Lord. Moreover, he commands the people that dwell in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord.

As soon as the commandment comes abroad, the children of Israel bring in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; the tithe of all things they bring in abundantly. The children of Israel and Judah that dwell in the cities of Judah also bring in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which are consecrated unto the Lord their God, and lay them in heaps. In the third month they begin to lay the foundation of the heaps and finish them in the seventh month. When Hezekiah and the princes come and see the heaps, they bless the Lord and his people Israel. Hezekiah inquires concerning the heaps, and Azariah the chief priest answers that since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, they have had enough to eat and plenty left, for the Lord has blessed his people, and that which is left is this great store. Hezekiah commands to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord; they prepare them and bring in the offerings and tithes faithfully. The chapter lists those who oversee the distribution to the priests and Levites by their divisions. Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, working what is good and right and truth before the Lord his God. In every work that he begins in the service of the house of God, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he does it with all his heart and prospers.

## 2 Chronicles 32: Sennacherib's Invasion

After these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria comes and enters Judah, encamps against the fenced cities, and thinks to win them for himself. When Hezekiah sees that Sennacherib has come and that he is purposed to fight against Jerusalem, he takes counsel with his princes and mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains outside the city, and they help him. Many people gather, and they stop all the fountains and the brook that runs through the midst of the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?" He strengthens himself, builds up all the wall that is broken, raises it up to the towers, and builds another wall without, and repairs Millo in the City of David, and makes weapons and shields in abundance.

He sets captains of war over the people, gathers them to him in the street of the gate of the city, and speaks comfortably to them, saying, "Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him. With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles." The people rest themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. After this, Sennacherib sends his servants to Jerusalem while he is at Lachish, to mock the God of Israel and to frighten the people, questioning their trust in Hezekiah and in the Lord, comparing the God of Jerusalem to the idols of the nations. His servants speak yet more against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah, writing letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel. They cry with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem that are on the wall, to frighten them and to trouble them.

For this cause, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz pray and cry to heaven. The Lord sends an angel, which cuts off all the mighty men of valor, the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. Sennacherib returns with shame to his own land. When he comes into the house of his god, those that come forth of his own bowels slay him there with the sword. Thus the Lord saves Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib and from the hand of all others and guides them on every side. Many bring gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he is magnified in the sight of all nations thereafter.

In those days Hezekiah is sick to the death and prays unto the Lord, who speaks unto him and gives him a sign. But Hezekiah renders not again according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart is lifted up; therefore there is wrath upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbles himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord comes not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. He has exceeding much riches and honor, makes treasuries for silver, gold, and precious stones, storehouses for grain, wine, and oil, stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks. He prospers in all his works. However, when envoys are sent from the princes of Babylon to inquire of the wonder done in the land, God leaves him to try him, to know all that is in his heart. Hezekiah sleeps with his fathers, and they bury him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honor him at his death. Manasseh his son reigns in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 33: Manasseh and Amon

Manasseh is twelve years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns fifty-five years in Jerusalem. He does that which is evil in the sight of the Lord, after the abominations of the heathen. He builds again the high places which Hezekiah his father has broken down, raises up altars for Baalim, makes groves, worships all the host of heaven, and serves them. He builds altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord has said, "In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever." In the two courts of the house of the Lord he builds altars for all the host of heaven. He causes his children to pass through the fire in the Valley of the son of Hinnom, observes times, uses enchantments, practices witchcraft, and deals with familiar spirits and wizards. He sets a carved image, the idol which he has made, in the house of God. He seduces Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord has destroyed.

The Lord speaks to Manasseh and to his people, but they will not hearken. Therefore the Lord brings upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria. They take Manasseh among the thorns, bind him with fetters, and carry him to Babylon. When he is in affliction, he besought the Lord his God and humbles himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prays unto him. God is intreated of him, hears his supplication, and brings him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knows that the Lord is God. Afterward he builds an outer wall of the City of David, raises it up, puts captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah, takes away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars he has built in the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem, and casts them out of the city. He repairs the altar of the Lord and sacrifices peace offerings and thank offerings, and commands Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel. Nevertheless, the people still sacrifice in the high places, yet unto the Lord their God only.

Manasseh sleeps with his fathers and is buried in his own house. Amon his son reigns in his stead. Amon is twenty-two years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns two years in Jerusalem. He does evil in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father. He sacrifices unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father has made and serves them. He does not humble himself before the Lord as Manasseh his father has humbled himself; but Amon trespasses more and more. His servants conspire against him and slay him in his own house. But the people of the land slay all those that have conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land make Josiah his son king in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 34: Josiah's Reforms

Josiah is eight years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns thirty-one years in Jerusalem. He does that which is right in the sight of the Lord, and walks in the ways of David his father, and declines neither to the right hand nor to the left. In the eighth year of his reign, while he is yet young, he begins to seek after the God of David his father. In the twelfth year he begins to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the groves, the carved images, and the molten images. He breaks down the altars of Baalim in his presence, cuts down the incense altars, breaks in pieces and makes dust of them, and scatters it upon the graves of those that have sacrificed unto them. He burns the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleanses Judah and Jerusalem. So he does in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

In the eighteenth year of his reign, he sends Shaphan, Maaseiah, and Joah to repair the house of the Lord his God. They come to Hilkiah the high priest, who gives them the money brought into the house of God. The workmen repair and amend the house. In the process, Hilkiah finds the book of the law of the Lord given by Moses. Hilkiah gives the book to Shaphan the scribe, who reads it. Shaphan brings the book to the king and reads therein. When the king hears the words of the law, he rends his clothes. He commands Hilkiah and others to inquire of the Lord concerning the words of the book, for great is the wrath of the Lord poured out upon them because their fathers have not kept the word of the Lord. They go to Huldah the prophetess, who dwells in Jerusalem. She delivers God's word: He will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants because they have forsaken Him, but because Josiah's heart is tender and he has humbled himself, he will be gathered to his fathers in peace and not see the evil that God will bring upon this place.

The king gathers all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem, goes up to the house of the Lord with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, and the Levites, and reads in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant. He stands in his place and makes a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord, to keep His commandments with all his heart and soul, to perform the words of the covenant written in the book. He causes all that are present to stand to it. Josiah takes away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertain to the children of Israel and makes all that are present in Israel serve the Lord their God. All his days they depart not from following the Lord, the God of their fathers.

## 2 Chronicles 35: Josiah's Passover and Death

Josiah keeps a Passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem, and they kill the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. He sets the priests in their charges and encourages them in the service of the house of the Lord. He tells the Levites, who teach all Israel and are holy unto the Lord, to put the holy ark in the house which Solomon has built and to serve the Lord and His people Israel. He arranges them in their courses according to the writing of David and Solomon. He gives to the people lambs and kids, all for the Passover offerings, and three thousand bullocks. His princes give willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites.

The service is prepared: the priests sprinkle the blood from their hands, and the Levites flay the animals. They roast the Passover with fire according to the ordinance and boil the other holy offerings in pots, caldrons, and pans, and carry them quickly to all the people. Afterward they prepare for themselves and for the priests, because the priests are busied in offering burnt offerings and fat until night. The singers, the sons of Asaph, are in their place according to the commandment of David, and the porters keep their ward. So all the service of the Lord is prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord. The children of Israel that are present keep the Passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. There is no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah does. This Passover is kept in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.

After all this, when Josiah has prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt comes up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates. Josiah goes out against him. Necho sends ambassadors to him, saying that he has no quarrel with Judah and that God has commanded him to make haste. Josiah will not turn his face from him but disguises himself to fight with him. He hearkens not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God and comes to fight in the valley of Megiddo. The archers shoot King Josiah; he is wounded and tells his servants to carry him away. They bring him to Jerusalem, where he dies. He is buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourn for Josiah. Jeremiah laments for Josiah, and all the singing men and women speak of Josiah in their lamentations to this day.

## 2 Chronicles 36: The Fall of Judah and the Exile

The people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah and make him king in Jerusalem. Jehoahaz is twenty-three years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns three months in Jerusalem. The king of Egypt deposes him in Jerusalem, lays a tribute upon the land, and carries Jehoahaz to Egypt. The king of Egypt makes Eliakim, brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah and Jerusalem and changes his name to Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns eleven years in Jerusalem. He does that which is evil in the sight of the Lord his God. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon comes up against him, binds him in fetters to carry him to Babylon, and carries part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon, putting them in his temple.

Jehoiachin his son reigns in his stead. Jehoiachin is eight (or eighteen) years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He does that which is evil in the sight of the Lord. At the turn of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sends and brings him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord, and makes Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah is twenty-one years old when he begins to reign, and he reigns eleven years in Jerusalem. He does evil in the sight of the Lord his God and does not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, speaking from the mouth of the Lord. He also rebels against King Nebuchadnezzar, who has made him swear by God. He stiffens his neck and hardens his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel. Moreover, all the chief of the priests and the people transgress very much after all the abominations of the heathen and pollute the house of the Lord.

The Lord God of their fathers sends to them by his messengers, rising up betimes and sending, because He has compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. But they mock the messengers of God, despise His words, and misuse His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arises against His people, till there is no remedy. Therefore He brings upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slays their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and has no compassion on young man or maiden, old man or him that stoops for age. He gives them all into his hand. All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king and his princes, he carries to Babylon. They burn the house of God, break down the wall of Jerusalem, burn all its palaces, and destroy all the precious vessels. Those who escape from the sword he carries away to Babylon, where they serve him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land has enjoyed her sabbaths; for as long as she lies desolate she keeps sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years.

In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirs up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he makes a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and puts it also in writing, saying, "Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up."
