# Ecclesiastes

## Ecclesiastes 1: All Is Vanity

The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem, begin with the declaration that all is vanity. He says that what a person gains from all labor under the sun is unclear, because generations come and go while the earth remains. The sun rises and sets and returns to its place. The wind moves in circuits. Rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full, and the rivers return again. He observes that all things are full of weariness; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

The Preacher states that what has been is what will be, and there is nothing new under the sun. If someone says something is new, it has already existed in earlier times. There is no lasting remembrance of former things, and future things will also not be remembered. He says he applied his heart to seek and search out by wisdom all things done under heaven. He describes this task as a heavy burden. He sees all the works done under the sun and calls them vanity and vexation of spirit, saying what is crooked cannot be made straight and what is lacking cannot be counted. He speaks of gaining wisdom and knowledge beyond those before him in Jerusalem, yet he finds that much wisdom brings much grief, and increasing knowledge increases sorrow.

## Ecclesiastes 2: The Vanity of Pleasure and Labor

The Preacher says he tests himself with pleasure to see what is good. He turns to laughter and calls it madness, and to mirth, questioning its value. He gives himself to wine while guiding his heart with wisdom, and he lays hold on folly to see what is good for people to do under heaven during their lives. He makes great works, builds houses, plants vineyards, gardens, and orchards, and plants trees of every kind. He makes pools of water, acquires servants, has great possessions of cattle and flocks, and gathers silver, gold, and treasures. He obtains singers and delights in many pleasures. He becomes great and surpasses all before him in Jerusalem, and his wisdom remains with him. Whatever his eyes desire, he does not withhold.

When he considers all his works and labor, he declares it vanity and vexation of spirit, with no lasting profit under the sun. He turns to consider wisdom, madness, and folly. He sees that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness, yet both the wise and the fool die alike, and both are forgotten. He says he hates life because the work under the sun is grievous. He hates all his labor because he must leave it to one who comes after him, who may be wise or foolish. He concludes that there is nothing better than that a person should eat, drink, and enjoy good in labor, and he says this also comes from the hand of God. God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to a person who is good in His sight, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

## Ecclesiastes 3: A Time for Everything

The Preacher declares that to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven. He lists times for birth and death, planting and plucking up, killing and healing, breaking down and building up, weeping and laughing, mourning and dancing. He names times for casting away stones and gathering stones, embracing and refraining, gaining and losing, keeping and casting away, tearing and sewing, silence and speaking, loving and hating, war and peace.

He asks what profit a worker has in his labor. He says God has made everything beautiful in its time and has set eternity in their heart, yet people cannot fully discover God's work from beginning to end. He says there is nothing better than to rejoice and do good in life, to eat, drink, and enjoy labor, which he calls a gift of God. He declares that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added or taken from it. He observes under the sun that in the place of judgment there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is iniquity. He says God will judge the righteous and the wicked. He reflects that people and animals share the same breath and all return to dust. He asks who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes downward. He concludes that there is nothing better than for a person to rejoice in his own works.

## Ecclesiastes 4: Oppression and Toil

The Preacher turns to consider the oppressions done under the sun. He sees the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter. Power is on the side of their oppressors, and they have no comforter. He declares the dead more fortunate than the living and says better than both is one who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work done under the sun. He observes that labor and skillful work arise from envy of one another, and he calls this vanity and vexation of spirit.

He describes the fool folding his hands and consuming his own flesh. He says better is a handful with quietness than two handfuls with labor and vexation of spirit. He observes one who is alone, without child or brother, yet there is no end to his labor and his eye is not satisfied with riches. He says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor; if one falls, the other lifts him. A threefold cord is not quickly broken. He also describes a poor and wise child better than an old and foolish king who will no longer be warned. He notes that those who come after will not rejoice in him. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

## Ecclesiastes 5: Reverence and Contentment

The Preacher instructs to keep one's foot when going to the house of God and to be ready to hear rather than to give the sacrifice of fools. He warns not to be rash with the mouth or hasty in speech before God, for God is in heaven and man upon earth. He says let words be few. He states that a dream comes through much activity and a fool's voice through many words. When making a vow to God, he says do not delay to pay it, for God has no pleasure in fools. It is better not to vow than to vow and not pay. He says do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, and do not say before the angel that it was an error.

He observes that if oppression of the poor and perversion of judgment are seen in a province, one should not marvel, for higher officials watch over lower ones. He notes that the profit of the earth is for all. He says one who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver. As goods increase, those who consume them increase. The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep. He describes riches kept to the hurt of their owner and riches lost through misfortune. As a person comes from his mother's womb, so he returns naked. He says this is a grievous evil. He declares it good and fitting for one to eat and drink and enjoy good in all labor under the sun, for this is his portion. If God gives riches and power to enjoy them, this is the gift of God.

## Ecclesiastes 6: The Vanity of Riches Without Enjoyment

The Preacher describes an evil he has seen under the sun: a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor so that he lacks nothing, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a stranger eats it. He calls this vanity and an evil disease. He speaks of a man who has many children and lives many years, yet his soul is not filled with good and he has no burial; he says a stillborn child is better than he, for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness.

He says all the labor of man is for his mouth, yet appetite is not filled. He asks what advantage the wise has over the fool. He says better is the sight of the eyes than wandering of desire; this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. He declares that what has been is already named and known that it is man; he cannot contend with one stronger than he. Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, he asks what is good for man in this life under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 7: Wisdom and Adversity

The Preacher states that a good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth. It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men. Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made better. He says the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than the song of fools.

He says wisdom is good with an inheritance and gives life to those who have it. He tells to consider the work of God, for who can make straight what He has made crooked. In prosperity be joyful, but in adversity consider that God sets one against the other. He observes that there is a just man who perishes in righteousness and a wicked man who prolongs life in wickedness. He warns not to be overly righteous or overly wicked. He says wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten rulers. He declares that there is not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin. He reflects on the devices of men and says God made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions.

## Ecclesiastes 8: Obedience and Mystery

The Preacher asks who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a thing. A person's wisdom makes his face shine. He instructs to keep the king's commandment because of the oath of God and not to stand in an evil thing. He says where the word of a king is, there is power. He declares that a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment, though man's misery is heavy upon him because he does not know what will be.

He observes that sentence against an evil work is not executed quickly, so the heart of people is set to do evil. Though a sinner does evil many times and his days are prolonged, the Preacher says it will be well with those who fear God. Yet he sees vanity under the sun: there are just men who receive what the wicked deserve and wicked men who receive what the righteous deserve. He commends joy, saying a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry, for that remains with him in labor. He says no one can fully find out the work done under the sun, even though he seeks it diligently.

## Ecclesiastes 9: Death and Living Wisely

The Preacher says he considers all this in his heart, that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God. No one knows love or hatred by what is before them. All share one event: the righteous and the wicked, the good and the unclean, those who sacrifice and those who do not. The same event happens to all. He says the living know they will die, but the dead know nothing and have no more reward, for their memory is forgotten. Their love, hatred, and envy have perished, and they no longer have a portion in anything done under the sun.

He urges to go, eat bread with joy, drink wine with a merry heart, let garments be white, and let the head lack no oil. Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life. Whatever the hand finds to do, do it with might, for there is no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave. He observes that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but time and chance happen to all. He tells of a small city saved by a poor wise man, yet no one remembered him. He concludes that wisdom is better than strength, yet a sinner destroys much good.

## Ecclesiastes 10: Wisdom and Folly

The Preacher says dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a bad odor, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left. When a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool. He advises not to leave one's place if the spirit of the ruler rises against him.

He describes evils he has seen under the sun, such as folly set in great dignity and the rich sitting in low place. He sees servants on horses and princes walking as servants. He warns that one who digs a pit may fall into it and one who breaks a hedge may be bitten by a serpent. He says if the iron is blunt, one must use more strength, but wisdom is profitable to direct. He notes that words of a wise man are gracious, but the lips of a fool swallow him up. He says through much sloth the building decays, and through idleness of hands the house drops through. He counsels not to curse the king even in thought, for a bird of the air may carry the voice.

## Ecclesiastes 11: Living Boldly and Remembering God

The Preacher urges to cast bread upon the waters, for it will be found after many days. He says to give a portion to seven and also to eight, for one does not know what evil will come upon the earth. If the clouds are full of rain, they empty upon the earth; if a tree falls, there it lies. He says one who observes the wind will not sow and one who regards the clouds will not reap. As one does not know the way of the spirit or how bones grow in the womb, so one does not know the works of God.

He advises to sow seed in the morning and not withhold the hand in the evening, for one does not know which will prosper. Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun. If a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them, yet remember the days of darkness. He calls youth and the prime of life vanity. He tells the young to rejoice in youth and walk in the ways of their heart and sight of their eyes, but know that God will bring them into judgment. He instructs to remove sorrow from the heart and put away evil from the flesh.

## Ecclesiastes 12: Remember Your Creator

The Preacher tells the young to remember their Creator in the days of youth before the evil days come and the years draw near when they say they have no pleasure in them. He describes the decline of life with images of the sun and light being darkened, the keepers of the house trembling, strong men bowing, grinders ceasing, and those looking out of the windows being darkened. He speaks of doors shut in the streets, the sound of grinding low, rising at the voice of a bird, and fears in the way. He describes the almond tree flourishing, the grasshopper being a burden, and desire failing, as a man goes to his long home and mourners go about the streets. He says the silver cord is loosed, the golden bowl broken, the pitcher shattered, and the wheel broken at the cistern. Then dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. The Preacher repeats that all is vanity.

A narrator voice describes the Preacher as wise, teaching the people knowledge and setting in order many proverbs. It says the words of the wise are like goads and firmly fixed nails given from one shepherd. The reader is warned that making many books has no end and much study wearies the flesh. The conclusion of the whole matter is stated: fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. It declares that God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
