# Hebrews

## 1–2: Christ superior to angels

The author begins by declaring that in these last days, God has spoken through His Son, who is the heir of all things and the creator of the worlds. The Son is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of His person, and after purging our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. He is far superior to the angels, having a more excellent name. The author supports this with several Old Testament quotations, showing that the Son is called God's Son, worshipped by angels, and has an eternal throne and kingdom. In contrast, the angels are ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation. Therefore, the readers should pay careful attention to the message of salvation spoken by the Lord and confirmed by eyewitnesses, a message accompanied by signs, wonders, and miracles from God. The world to come is not subject to angels, but to man, as quoted from Psalm 8. Jesus was made a little lower than the angels for a short time so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone. Through His suffering, He became the captain of their salvation, sanctifying them and calling them brethren. By partaking of flesh and blood, He could, through death, destroy the devil and release those who were in bondage to the fear of death. He became a merciful and faithful high priest to make propitiation for the sins of the people, and because He Himself has suffered and been tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted.

## 3–4: Christ superior to Moses + entering rest

The author urges the holy brethren to consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of their confession, who was faithful to God who appointed Him. Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. Moses was a faithful servant in God's house, but Christ is a faithful Son over God's house. The author then warns the readers not to harden their hearts as the Israelites did in the wilderness, which led to their failure to enter God's rest. The promise of entering God's rest still stands, and they must be diligent to enter that rest, lest any of them fall short through disobedience. The word of God is living and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. All things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom they must give account. Since they have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, they should hold fast their confession. For they do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with their weaknesses, but one who was in all points tempted as they are, yet without sin. Therefore, they can come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

## 5–7: Christ the high priest

Every high priest is taken from among men and appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can have compassion on the ignorant and those who are straying, since he himself is also subject to weakness. No one takes this honor upon himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but was appointed by God, who said to Him, "You are My Son, today I have begotten You," and, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." During His earthly life, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear. Though He was a Son, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him. The author then introduces the topic of Melchizedek, a priest of the Most High God and king of Salem, who met Abraham and blessed him. Abraham gave him a tithe of all. Melchizedek, without father, mother, or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, remains a priest continually. The author argues that the Levitical priesthood was imperfect, and a change of priesthood necessitates a change of the law. Jesus, who is from the tribe of Judah, has become a priest not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning physical descent but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life, as testified: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant. Unlike the Levitical priests who were many because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, Jesus holds His priesthood permanently because He continues forever. Therefore, He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.

## 8–10: New covenant + Christ's sacrifice

The main point is that we have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man. He has obtained a more excellent ministry, and is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises. The author quotes from Jeremiah to describe the new covenant, in which God will put His laws in their minds and write them on their hearts, and He will remember their sins no more. The first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. The priests went regularly into the outer part, but only the high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year, and not without blood. This symbolized that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest. But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands. He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. The blood of Christ cleanses our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. For this reason, He is the Mediator of the new covenant. The law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things. The sacrifices offered year after year could never make the worshipers perfect. But Christ, when He came into the world, said, "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me." By that will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. By one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering and consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. The author warns that if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment.

## 11: Faith examples

This chapter is a great discourse on faith, defining it as the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. By faith, the elders obtained a good testimony. By faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. The author then provides a long list of Old Testament figures who lived by faith. Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death. Noah prepared an ark for the saving of his household. Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance, and he dwelt in the land of promise in tents with Isaac and Jacob. Sarah received strength to conceive seed and bore a child when she was past the age. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau. By faith, Jacob blessed each of the sons of Joseph. By faith, Joseph gave instructions concerning his bones. By faith, Moses' parents hid him for three months. By faith, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God. He forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king. By faith, he kept the Passover. By faith, the Israelites passed through the Red Sea. By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down. By faith, Rahab the harlot did not perish. The author mentions Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, and turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. They suffered mocking, scourgings, chains, and imprisonment. They were stoned, sawn in two, and were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, and tormented. All these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise, God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.

## 12–13: Endurance + final instructions

Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. He endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. The readers are encouraged to consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest they become weary and discouraged. The author reminds them that they have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in their striving against sin. He exhorts them not to despise the chastening of the Lord, for whom the Lord loves He chastens. If they endure chastening, God deals with them as with sons. He encourages them to pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord. He warns them against bitterness, sexual immorality, and profanity, like Esau who sold his birthright. He contrasts the terrifying experience of the Israelites at Mount Sinai with the believers' access to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. He urges them to see that they do not refuse Him who speaks. The author concludes with a series of exhortations. Let brotherly love continue. Be hospitable to strangers. Remember the prisoners and those who are mistreated. Marriage is honorable in all. Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the word of God to you. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. He encourages them to go forth to Jesus, outside the camp, bearing His reproach, for here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. Through Jesus, let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God. Do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. Obey those who rule over you and be submissive. The epistle ends with a prayer for the readers, a final greeting, and a blessing of grace.
