# Zechariah

## Zechariah 1: Call to Return and Vision of Horses

The word of the LORD comes to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, telling the people not to be like their fathers who refuse to listen to the earlier prophets. The LORD reminds them that their fathers experience the consequences of disobedience. The people acknowledge that the LORD deals with them according to their ways and actions.

In the eighth month, Zechariah sees a vision at night. He sees a man riding a red horse standing among myrtle trees in a low place, with red, speckled, and white horses behind him. Zechariah asks what they are. The angel speaking with him explains that these are sent to walk through the earth. They report that the earth sits still and is at rest. The angel of the LORD asks how long Jerusalem and the cities of Judah will lack mercy. The LORD answers with comforting words, declaring jealousy for Jerusalem and anger toward nations at ease. He promises to return to Jerusalem with mercy, rebuild His house, and stretch a measuring line over the city. Zechariah then sees four horns that scatter Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem, followed by four craftsmen who come to terrify and cast down those horns.

## Zechariah 2: The Measuring Line and Jerusalem's Future

Zechariah sees a man with a measuring line going to measure Jerusalem. Another angel tells him that Jerusalem will be inhabited as towns without walls because of the multitude of people and cattle. The LORD declares He will be a wall of fire around her and glory within her.

The LORD calls those in Babylon to flee from the land of the north. He says whoever touches His people touches the apple of His eye. Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day. He declares that He will dwell in the midst of Zion, and all flesh is commanded to be silent before Him.

## Zechariah 3: Joshua the High Priest and the Branch

Zechariah sees Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, with Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD rebukes Satan and describes Jerusalem as a brand plucked from the fire. Joshua stands clothed in filthy garments. The angel commands that his garments be removed and replaced with clean clothing and a fair mitre on his head.

The angel of the LORD charges Joshua to walk in the LORD's ways. He speaks of bringing forth His servant called the Branch and sets a stone before Joshua with seven eyes upon it. The LORD promises to remove the iniquity of the land in one day and declares that every man will invite his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.

## Zechariah 4: The Golden Candlestick and Zerubbabel

The angel wakes Zechariah and shows him a golden candlestick with a bowl on top, seven lamps, and seven pipes, with two olive trees beside it. Zechariah asks what these are. The angel tells him this is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: not by might nor by power, but by the LORD's Spirit. The great mountain before Zerubbabel will become a plain, and he will bring forth the headstone with shouts of grace.

The LORD declares that Zerubbabel's hands lay the foundation of the house and will also finish it. The seven eyes of the LORD run through the whole earth. The two olive trees are identified as the two anointed ones who stand by the LORD of the whole earth.

## Zechariah 5: The Flying Scroll and the Ephah

Zechariah sees a flying scroll twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. The angel says it is the curse that goes over the face of the whole earth, entering the house of the thief and the one who swears falsely, consuming it.

He then sees an ephah going forth. A woman sits inside it, and the angel calls her Wickedness. He casts her back into the ephah and seals it with a lead cover. Two women with wings like storks lift the ephah between earth and heaven to build a house for it in the land of Shinar.

## Zechariah 6: The Four Chariots and the Branch

Zechariah sees four chariots coming between two mountains of brass. The first has red horses, the second black, the third white, and the fourth speckled and strong horses. The angel says these are the four spirits of heaven going forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.

The LORD commands that silver and gold be taken to make crowns and set upon the head of Joshua the high priest. He speaks of the Branch who will build the temple of the LORD, bear the glory, sit and rule upon His throne, and be a priest upon His throne.

## Zechariah 7: The Question About Fasting

In the fourth year of King Darius, men from Bethel send to ask the priests and prophets whether they should continue fasting in the fifth month as they have done for many years. The word of the LORD comes, asking whether their fasting is truly for Him.

The LORD reminds them how He calls their fathers to execute true judgment, show mercy and compassion, and not oppress the widow, fatherless, stranger, or poor. Their fathers refuse to listen and are scattered among the nations. The land becomes desolate because of their actions.

## Zechariah 8: Promises of Restoration

The LORD declares strong jealousy for Zion and promises to return and dwell in Jerusalem, which will be called the city of truth. Old men and women will sit in its streets, and children will play there.

He promises to save His people from east and west and bring them to dwell in Jerusalem. The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become joy and gladness. Many nations will come to seek the LORD in Jerusalem. Ten men from every language will take hold of the skirt of one who is a Jew, saying God is with you.

## Zechariah 9: Judgment on Nations and the Coming King

The burden of the word of the LORD comes against Hadrach, Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, and Zidon. He describes judgment on Philistia and promises to encamp around His house.

He calls Zion to rejoice because her King comes, just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon an ass. He speaks of cutting off the chariot and bow of battle and extending peace to the nations. He promises to strengthen Judah and save the house of Joseph.

## Zechariah 10: The LORD Will Visit His Flock

The LORD urges the people to ask Him for rain in the time of the latter rain. He condemns idols and false shepherds. He declares anger against the shepherds and says He will visit His flock, the house of Judah.

He promises to strengthen Judah and save the house of Joseph, bringing them again and gathering them out of Egypt and Assyria. They will walk up and down in His name.

## Zechariah 11: The Flock of Slaughter

The chapter opens with imagery of Lebanon and Bashan in mourning. Zechariah is commanded to feed the flock of slaughter. He takes two staffs called Beauty and Bands and feeds the flock.

He cuts off three shepherds in one month. The flock despises him, and he breaks the staff Beauty to break the covenant. He asks for his wages and receives thirty pieces of silver, which he casts to the potter in the house of the LORD. He breaks the second staff Bands to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD describes a foolish shepherd who will not care for the flock.

## Zechariah 12: Jerusalem a Cup of Trembling

The LORD declares Himself the one who stretches forth the heavens and forms the spirit of man. He says Jerusalem will be a cup of trembling and a burdensome stone for all people.

He promises to defend Jerusalem and pour upon the house of David the spirit of grace and supplication. They will look upon Him whom they pierce and mourn as for an only son.

## Zechariah 13: Cleansing and the Smitten Shepherd

A fountain will be opened to cleanse from sin and uncleanness. Idols and false prophets will be cut off. A prophet will deny being a prophet and say he is a farmer.

The LORD says, "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd." The shepherd is smitten, and the sheep are scattered. Two parts are cut off and die, and the third part is brought through the fire and refined.

## Zechariah 14: The Day of the LORD

A day of the LORD comes when Jerusalem's spoil is divided. All nations gather against Jerusalem. The LORD goes forth to fight, and His feet stand upon the mount of Olives, which splits in two.

Living waters flow out from Jerusalem. The LORD becomes king over all the earth. Jerusalem is lifted up and inhabited safely. The nations that fight against it suffer plague. Those left of the nations come yearly to worship the King and keep the feast of tabernacles. Holiness to the LORD is written upon the bells of the horses, and every pot in Jerusalem is holy.
