# 3 John

The elder writes to the well-beloved Gaius, whom he loves in the truth. He expresses his wish that Gaius may prosper and be in good health, just as his soul prospers. The elder rejoices greatly because brethren have testified to the truth that is in Gaius and that he walks in the truth. He states that he has no greater joy than to hear that his children are walking in the truth.

The elder commends Gaius for his faithful service to the brethren and to strangers, who have borne witness of his love before the church. He encourages Gaius to continue supporting them on their journey in a manner worthy of God, because they went forth for His name's sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, he says, we ought to receive such people, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.

The elder mentions that he wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive them. He says that when he comes, he will call to mind the deeds which Diotrephes does, prattling against them with malicious words. Not content with that, Diotrephes himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church.

The elder admonishes Gaius not to imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. He speaks well of Demetrius, who has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. The elder also bears witness, and he knows that their testimony is true.

He concludes by saying that he has many things to write, but he would rather not use paper and ink. Instead, he trusts that he will see Gaius shortly, and they will speak face to face. He sends greetings of peace and asks Gaius to greet their friends by name.
