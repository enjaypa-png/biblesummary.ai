# Jude

Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, writes to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ. He had intended to write about their common salvation, but found it necessary to write and exhort them to earnestly contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.

He warns that certain ungodly men have crept in unnoticed, who were long ago marked out for condemnation. They turn the grace of God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. He reminds his readers of how God, after saving the people of Israel out of Egypt, later destroyed those who did not believe. He also mentions the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, whom God has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day. He also gives the example of Sodom and Gomorrah, which are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

These false teachers are described as dreamers who defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries. In contrast, Michael the archangel, in a dispute with the devil about the body of Moses, did not bring a reviling accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!" But these people speak evil of whatever they do not know, and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves.

Jude pronounces a woe upon them, for they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. They are spots in their love feasts, clouds without water, late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.

Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him." These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage.

Jude exhorts his readers to remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.

He encourages them to build themselves up on their most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, to keep themselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And on some have compassion, making a distinction; but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.

The epistle concludes with a doxology: "Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, And to present you faultless Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever. Amen."
