# James

## 1

James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes scattered abroad. He encourages them to count it all joy when they fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of their faith produces patience. If any of them lacks wisdom, they should ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach. However, they must ask in faith, without doubting, for a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. The brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his exaltation, but the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the field he will pass away. Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life. No one should say when he is tempted that he is tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone. Each person is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. James urges his beloved brethren to be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. They must be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving themselves. Pure and undefiled religion before God is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.

James warns against holding the faith of Jesus Christ with partiality. He presents a scenario where a rich man in fine apparel and a poor man in filthy clothes enter their assembly. If they show deference to the rich man and contempt for the poor man, they have become judges with evil thoughts. God has chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom. To show partiality is to commit sin and be convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, is guilty of all. He then transitions to the relationship between faith and works, stating that faith without works is dead. He argues that it is not enough to say one has faith; that faith must be demonstrated by actions. If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, be warmed and filled," but does not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? He uses the examples of Abraham, who was justified by works when he offered Isaac, and Rahab the harlot, who was justified by works when she received the messengers. Just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

James cautions his brethren against becoming teachers, knowing that they will receive a stricter judgment. He speaks of the power of the tongue, which, though a small member, boasts great things. It is like the bit in a horse's mouth or the rudder of a ship, able to direct the whole body. The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity, that defiles the whole body and is set on fire by hell. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. With it, they bless God and curse men, who are made in the similitude of God. This should not be. A fountain cannot send forth both fresh and salt water, nor can a fig tree bear olives. James then contrasts two types of wisdom. The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. But if they have bitter envy and self-seeking in their hearts, this wisdom is earthly, sensual, and demonic. Where envy and self-seeking exist, there is confusion and every evil thing. The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

James asks where wars and fights come from among them, and answers that they come from their desires for pleasure that war in their members. They lust and do not have, so they murder and covet and cannot obtain. They fight and war, yet they do not have because they do not ask. And when they do ask, they do not receive, because they ask amiss, that they may spend it on their pleasures. He calls them adulterers and adulteresses, warning that friendship with the world is enmity with God. He exhorts them to submit to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from them. They are to draw near to God, and He will draw near to them. They should cleanse their hands and purify their hearts. He instructs them to humble themselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift them up. They are not to speak evil of one another. He rebukes those who make plans for the future without considering God's will, saying they ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that." To know to do good and not do it, to him it is sin.

James issues a stern warning to the rich, telling them to weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon them. Their riches are corrupted, and their garments are moth-eaten. Their gold and silver are corroded, and their rust will be a witness against them. They have heaped up treasure in the last days and have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury. The wages of the laborers they have kept back by fraud cry out, and the cries have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. He encourages the brethren to be patient until the coming of the Lord, just as the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth. They are to establish their hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. They should not grumble against one another, lest they be condemned. He points to the prophets and Job as examples of suffering and patience. Above all, they are not to swear, but let their "Yes" be "Yes," and their "No," "No." He gives practical instructions for the church: Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone sick? Let him call for the elders of the church to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick. They are to confess their trespasses to one another and pray for one another, that they may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much, as exemplified by Elijah. The epistle concludes with the assurance that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.
