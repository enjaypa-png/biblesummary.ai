# 1 Kings

## 1 Kings 1: Solomon Becomes King

As King David is old and frail, his fourth son, Adonijah, makes a bid for the throne. He gathers the support of Joab, David's long-time military commander, and Abiathar the priest, and begins to act as king, complete with a royal procession. However, he does not invite the prophet Nathan, the priest Zadok, Benaiah (the captain of David's personal guard), or his own half-brother, Solomon.

Nathan the prophet learns of Adonijah's conspiracy and acts quickly to ensure David's promise to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, is fulfilled. He instructs Bathsheba to go to King David and remind him of his oath that Solomon would be his successor. As she is speaking with the king, Nathan enters to confirm her report. Stirred to action, David gives immediate orders for Solomon to be anointed as king. Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah lead Solomon on David's own mule to the Gihon Spring, where he is anointed. The trumpet is blown, and the people celebrate, shouting, "God save king Solomon!" The news quickly reaches Adonijah's feast, and his supporters, realizing their plot has failed, abandon him in fear. Adonijah himself flees and takes hold of the horns of the altar, seeking sanctuary. Solomon grants him a conditional pardon, telling him he will be spared as long as he shows himself to be a worthy man.

## 1 Kings 2: David's Final Charge and Solomon's Consolidation of Power

As David's death approaches, he gives his final charge to his son and successor, Solomon. He first exhorts him to be strong and to be faithful to the covenant of the Lord, keeping His statutes and commandments, so that he may prosper and that the Lord may fulfill the promise of the Davidic dynasty. David then gives Solomon a series of political instructions, advising him on how to deal with certain men who had been part of his own long and complex reign. He tells Solomon to bring justice upon Joab for his past murders and upon Shimei for his curses, and to show kindness to the sons of Barzillai, who had supported David during Absalom's rebellion. After giving this charge, David dies and is buried in the City of David.

Solomon moves swiftly to consolidate his power and settle the accounts his father had left him. Adonijah makes a fatal political mistake by asking Bathsheba to request that Solomon give him Abishag, David's last companion, as a wife—a request that could be seen as a claim to the throne. Solomon sees through the ploy and has Adonijah executed. He also deals with Adonijah's co-conspirators: he banishes the priest Abiathar to his hometown, thus fulfilling the prophecy against the house of Eli, and he has the treacherous Joab executed, even as he clings to the horns of the altar. Finally, he places Shimei under a form of house arrest in Jerusalem, which Shimei violates three years later, leading to his own execution. With all his rivals eliminated, Solomon's kingdom is firmly established.

## 1 Kings 3: Solomon's Wisdom

Solomon makes a political alliance with Egypt by marrying the Pharaoh's daughter. At this time, the people are still sacrificing at various "high places" because the Temple has not yet been built. Solomon himself offers a thousand burnt offerings at the great high place in Gibeon. That night, the Lord appears to Solomon in a dream and says, "Ask what I shall give thee."

Instead of asking for long life, riches, or victory over his enemies, Solomon humbly asks for wisdom. He acknowledges his own youth and inexperience and requests "an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad." God is pleased with this selfless request and grants him not only unparalleled wisdom but also the riches and honor he did not ask for. As a demonstration of this divine wisdom, the chapter recounts the famous story of the two prostitutes who come before Solomon. Both women have recently given birth, and one of their infants has died. Both now claim the living child as their own. Solomon, in a brilliant display of insight into human nature, calls for a sword and orders the living child to be cut in two, with half given to each woman. The true mother, in her love for the child, cries out for the baby's life to be spared, even if it means giving him to the other woman. The liar, however, callously agrees to the division. Solomon immediately identifies the true mother and gives her the child. The news of this judgment spreads throughout Israel, and the people hold their king in awe, for they see that he has wisdom from God to administer justice.

## 1 Kings 4: Solomon's Administration and Prosperity

This chapter details the administrative structure and the immense prosperity of Solomon's kingdom at its zenith. It begins by listing Solomon's chief officials, including the priests, secretaries, recorder, commander of the army, and the head of the district governors. The kingdom is organized into twelve administrative districts, each responsible for providing provisions for the royal court for one month of the year. This system ensures a steady and equitable supply of resources for the vast royal household.

The description of Solomon's kingdom emphasizes its peace, prosperity, and vast extent. The people of Judah and Israel are described as being as numerous as the sand on the seashore, living in safety, "every man under his vine and under his fig tree," a classic biblical image of peace and prosperity. Solomon's dominion extends over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. The chapter also highlights the immense scale of his court's daily provisions and the vast number of horses and chariots he maintains. The chapter concludes by extolling Solomon's legendary wisdom, which is said to surpass that of all the wise men of the East and of Egypt. He is credited with composing 3,005 proverbs and 1,005 songs, and his knowledge of the natural world—from trees to animals—is encyclopedic. His fame spreads to all the surrounding nations, and kings and scholars from all over the world come to hear his wisdom.

## 1 Kings 5: Preparations for the Temple

With his kingdom at peace, Solomon begins to make preparations for the great work of his reign: the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, a task his father David had longed to do. He sends a message to Hiram, the king of Tyre, who had been a friend and ally of his father. Solomon reminds Hiram of David's intention to build the Temple and explains that he is now in a position to carry out the project. He proposes a trade agreement: Hiram is to supply Solomon with cedar and fir logs from the famous forests of Lebanon, and in return, Solomon will provide Hiram's court with wheat and olive oil.

Hiram is delighted with the proposal and agrees to the terms. The two kings make a treaty of peace. Solomon institutes a nationwide levy, conscripting 30,000 Israelite men to work in Lebanon in monthly shifts. He also uses a massive labor force of 70,000 carriers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, overseen by 3,300 foremen. These workers quarry large, high-quality stones, which are dressed at the quarry before being brought to the Temple site. The chapter emphasizes the scale and organization of this massive public works project, a joint effort between the Israelites and the skilled craftsmen of Tyre.

## 1 Kings 6: The Building of the Temple

This chapter provides a detailed architectural description of the Temple of the Lord, which Solomon begins to build in the 480th year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. The construction is carried out with meticulous care and precision. The stones are all prepared at the quarry, so that no sound of a hammer, chisel, or any other iron tool is heard at the Temple site during its construction. The main building is sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. The interior is paneled with cedar, from floor to ceiling, so that no stone is visible, and the floor is made of juniper planks. The entire interior is overlaid with pure gold.

The inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place, is a perfect cube of twenty cubits. Inside it, Solomon places two large cherubim, each ten cubits high, made of olive wood and overlaid with gold. Their outstretched wings span the entire width of the room. The walls are carved with figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. The chapter specifies the dimensions of the portico, the main hall, and the side chambers that are built around the Temple. The construction of the main structure takes seven years to complete.

## 1 Kings 7: Solomon's Palace and the Temple Furnishings

After completing the Temple, Solomon builds his own royal palace, a project that takes thirteen years. The palace complex is a magnificent series of buildings, including the "House of the Forest of Lebanon," named for its many cedar pillars, the "Hall of Pillars," and the "Hall of the Throne" or "Hall of Judgment," where Solomon would administer justice. He also builds a palace for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter. Like the Temple, these buildings are constructed with high-quality, costly stones and cedar wood.

The second half of the chapter details the casting of the bronze furnishings for the Temple, a task overseen by a master craftsman named Huram (or Hiram) from Tyre, who is skilled in all kinds of bronze work. He casts two massive bronze pillars, which are named Jachin and Boaz, and places them at the entrance to the Temple. He also creates the "Sea," a huge circular bronze basin that holds water for the priests' ceremonial washing, which rests on the backs of twelve bronze oxen. In addition, he makes ten movable bronze stands, or carts, each with a basin, as well as all the other bronze utensils needed for the Temple services, such as pots, shovels, and bowls. The chapter concludes by listing the golden furnishings for the interior of the Temple, including the altar of incense, the table for the bread of the Presence, the lampstands, and the various utensils, all made of pure gold.

## 1 Kings 8: The Dedication of the Temple

When the construction is complete, Solomon assembles the elders and leaders of Israel in Jerusalem for the dedication of the Temple. The priests bring the Ark of the Covenant from the City of David and place it in the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. When the priests withdraw, the glory of the Lord, in the form of a thick cloud, fills the Temple, so that the priests cannot stand to minister. Solomon then offers a blessing to the people and delivers a public address, recounting the history of the project from his father David's time and acknowledging that it is the fulfillment of God's promise.

Solomon then stands before the altar and offers a long and beautiful prayer of dedication. He praises God for His faithfulness to His covenant with David and acknowledges that even the highest heavens cannot contain God, much less this house he has built. He asks that God's eyes would be open toward this Temple day and night and that He would hear the prayers of His people when they pray toward this place. He intercedes for the people in various situations—when they sin, when they are defeated in battle, when there is drought or famine, and when foreigners come to pray. He asks for forgiveness, restoration, and blessing. After the prayer, Solomon blesses the people again, and they celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for fourteen days with great joy and feasting, offering an enormous number of sacrifices. Then Solomon sends the people home, and they go to their tents with joyful and glad hearts for all the good that the Lord has done for David His servant and for Israel His people.

## 1 Kings 9: God's Second Warning and Solomon's Other Achievements

After the dedication of the Temple and the royal palace, the Lord appears to Solomon a second time, as He had at Gibeon. God affirms that He has heard Solomon's prayer and has consecrated the Temple as His dwelling place. He then reiterates the conditions of the Davidic Covenant. If Solomon and his descendants walk faithfully before the Lord, as David did, then the royal throne of Israel will be established forever. However, God also gives a stern warning: if they turn away from the Lord, worship other gods, and forsake His commandments, then God will cut Israel off from the land, reject the Temple, and make Israel a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.

The rest of the chapter summarizes some of Solomon's other accomplishments. It mentions his ongoing building projects, for which he uses forced labor from the non-Israelite peoples remaining in the land. It also describes his naval expeditions, undertaken in partnership with Hiram of Tyre. Solomon builds a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, on the Red Sea, and they sail to the land of Ophir, from which they bring back a massive quantity of gold, as well as precious stones and fine wood.

## 1 Kings 10: The Queen of Sheba

The fame of Solomon's wisdom and wealth reaches the Queen of Sheba, in a distant land in southern Arabia. She travels to Jerusalem with a great caravan, bearing spices, gold, and precious stones, to test Solomon with hard questions. She puts her difficult questions to him, and Solomon is able to answer them all; nothing is too hard for him to explain. The queen is completely overwhelmed by what she sees and hears.

She is impressed not only by his wisdom but also by the magnificence of his court—the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the splendor of his palace, and the burnt offerings he makes at the Temple. She declares that the report she had heard in her own country did not do him justice; his wisdom and prosperity far exceed her expectations. She praises the happiness of his people and blesses the Lord his God, who has delighted in him and set him on the throne of Israel. She then gives Solomon a lavish gift of gold, spices, and precious stones, and he, in turn, gives her whatever she desires. The chapter concludes with a detailed description of Solomon's immense wealth, his golden shields, his magnificent ivory throne overlaid with gold, his golden drinking vessels, and his fleet of trading ships that brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Solomon surpasses all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.

## 1 Kings 11: Solomon's Apostasy and His Adversaries

This chapter marks the tragic turning point in Solomon's reign. Despite his wisdom, Solomon's heart is turned away from the Lord. He loves many foreign women, including the daughter of Pharaoh, as well as women from the Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite nations—nations with which the Lord had forbidden Israel to intermarry, "for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." Solomon has 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines, and as he grows old, his wives lead him astray.

He begins to follow their gods, building high places for Chemosh, the god of Moab, and for Molech, the god of the Ammonites, on a hill east of Jerusalem. He does the same for all his foreign wives who burn incense and offer sacrifices to their gods. The Lord becomes angry with Solomon because his heart has turned away from the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice and had warned him specifically about this. The Lord declares that He will tear the kingdom away from Solomon and give it to his servant. However, for the sake of David his father, God will not do it in Solomon's lifetime but will tear it out of the hand of his son. He will not tear away the entire kingdom but will leave one tribe (Judah) for his son to rule. As a consequence of Solomon's apostasy, the Lord raises up adversaries against him: Hadad the Edomite and Rezon of Zobah, who cause trouble for Israel. The Lord also raises up an internal adversary, Jeroboam the son of Nebat, one of Solomon's own officials. The prophet Ahijah meets Jeroboam on the road, tears his new garment into twelve pieces, and gives ten of them to Jeroboam, prophesying that God will give him ten tribes to rule. Solomon tries to kill Jeroboam, but he escapes to Egypt, where he remains until Solomon's death. Solomon reigns in Jerusalem for forty years and is then buried in the City of David.

## 1 Kings 12: The Kingdom Divides

After Solomon's death, his son Rehoboam goes to Shechem to be crowned king over all Israel. The people, led by the newly returned Jeroboam, come to Rehoboam with a request: if he will lighten the heavy burden of labor and taxation that his father Solomon had imposed on them, they will serve him loyally. Rehoboam asks for three days to consider their request. He first consults the old men who had served as his father's advisors. They wisely counsel him to speak kindly to the people and to grant their request, which would win their loyalty forever.

However, Rehoboam rejects this wise counsel and turns instead to the young men he had grown up with. They give him foolish and arrogant advice: he should tell the people that his little finger is thicker than his father's waist and that if his father burdened them with a heavy yoke, he will make it even heavier; if his father scourged them with whips, he will scourge them with scorpions. Rehoboam follows this disastrous advice. When he gives his harsh answer to the people, the ten northern tribes revolt, shouting, "What portion have we in David? … To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" When Rehoboam sends out Adoniram, the head of forced labor, the people stone him to death. Rehoboam himself barely escapes back to Jerusalem. The ten northern tribes make Jeroboam their king, leaving Rehoboam with only the tribe of Judah. The united kingdom is now permanently divided. Fearing that his people will return their allegiance to the house of David if they continue to go to the Temple in Jerusalem to worship, Jeroboam sets up two golden calves, one in Bethel and one in Dan, and tells the people, "Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." This act of idolatry becomes the defining sin of the northern kingdom of Israel.

## 1 Kings 13: The Man of God from Judah

As King Jeroboam is standing by his newly erected altar in Bethel to make an offering, a man of God comes from Judah and delivers a prophecy against the altar. He declares that a future king of Judah, named Josiah, will one day sacrifice the priests of the high places on this very altar. As a sign that this prophecy is from the Lord, he says the altar will split apart and its ashes will be poured out. When Jeroboam hears this, he stretches out his hand and orders the man to be seized, but his hand withers, and he cannot pull it back. At the same moment, the altar splits apart, just as the man of God had said. The terrified king begs the man of God to intercede for him, and when the prophet prays, Jeroboam's hand is restored.

Jeroboam invites the man of God to his home for a meal and a reward, but the prophet refuses, stating that the Lord had commanded him not to eat or drink in that place and to return to Judah by a different road. However, an old prophet from Bethel hears what has happened and goes after the man of God. He lies to him, claiming that an angel had given him a new command from the Lord to bring him back for a meal. The man of God from Judah believes the lie and goes back with him. While they are eating, the word of the Lord comes to the old prophet, and he pronounces judgment on the man of God from Judah for his disobedience. As the man of God is on his way home, a lion meets him on the road and kills him. The lion, however, does not eat the body or harm the donkey, a sign that this is a divine judgment. The old prophet retrieves the body and buries it in his own tomb, instructing his sons to bury him beside the man of God when he dies, for he knows the prophecy against the altar at Bethel will surely come to pass.

## 1 Kings 14: The End of Two Dynasties

Jeroboam's son, Abijah, becomes ill. Jeroboam sends his wife in disguise to the prophet Ahijah—the same prophet who had foretold his rise to power—to ask if the boy will recover. The prophet, though now old and blind, is told by the Lord that Jeroboam's wife is coming. He greets her by name and delivers a harsh message of judgment against Jeroboam and his house. Because Jeroboam has led Israel into idolatry with his golden calves, the Lord will cut off his dynasty completely. He tells her that the child will die as soon as she re-enters her city and that he is the only one of Jeroboam's house who will be given a proper burial, because in him there was found some good toward the Lord. The rest of his family will be eaten by dogs or by birds. As she returns home, the prophecy is fulfilled, and the child dies. Jeroboam reigns for twenty-two years and is succeeded by his son Nadab.

Meanwhile, in the southern kingdom of Judah, Rehoboam also leads the people into sin, and they do more to provoke the Lord's anger than their ancestors had done. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacks Jerusalem and carries off the treasures of the Temple and the royal palace, including the golden shields Solomon had made. Rehoboam replaces them with bronze shields. After a reign of seventeen years, marked by constant warfare with Jeroboam, Rehoboam dies and is succeeded by his son Abijam, who continues in his father's sinful ways. Abijam is succeeded by his son Asa, who is a righteous king and institutes religious reforms. The chapter then returns to the northern kingdom, where Jeroboam's son Nadab is assassinated by Baasha, who then seizes the throne and, in fulfillment of Ahijah's prophecy, kills Jeroboam's entire family, wiping out his dynasty.

## 1 Kings 15: Kings of Judah and Israel

This chapter provides a synchronized history of the kings of Judah and Israel, highlighting their successes, failures, and the ongoing conflict between the two kingdoms. It begins with Abijam's short and sinful reign in Judah, followed by the long and righteous reign of his son, Asa. Asa is commended for doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord, like his ancestor David. He expels the male shrine prostitutes from the land, gets rid of the idols his ancestors had made, and even deposes his own grandmother, Maakah, from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive image for the goddess Asherah. However, the high places are not removed. Asa's reign is marked by constant war with Baasha, the king of Israel.

To gain an advantage over Baasha, Asa makes a treaty with Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram (Syria), bribing him with the treasures from the Temple and the royal palace to break his treaty with Baasha. Ben-Hadad agrees and attacks the northern cities of Israel, forcing Baasha to withdraw from his fortification of Ramah. The chapter then summarizes the reigns of several kings of Israel. Baasha, who had usurped the throne from Jeroboam's son, is a wicked king who continues in the sin of Jeroboam. He is succeeded by his son Elah, who is assassinated by Zimri, one of his chariot commanders, while he is getting drunk. Zimri becomes king and, like Baasha before him, wipes out the entire family of his predecessor. His reign, however, is the shortest in Israel's history, lasting only seven days.

## 1 Kings 16: The Rise of the House of Omri

The chapter continues the bloody and unstable history of the northern kingdom of Israel. When the Israelite army, which is besieging a Philistine town, hears that Zimri has assassinated King Elah and seized the throne, they immediately proclaim their commander, Omri, as the new king. Omri leads the army to the capital city of Tirzah and besieges it. When Zimri sees that the city is taken, he retreats into the citadel of the royal palace, sets it on fire, and dies in the flames. The kingdom is then briefly divided, with half the people supporting a man named Tibni and the other half supporting Omri. Omri's faction proves stronger, and after Tibni is killed, Omri becomes the undisputed king.

Omri is described as a powerful and significant king from a secular perspective. He buys the hill of Samaria, builds a new city on it, and makes it the new capital of the northern kingdom. From a religious perspective, however, he is even more wicked than all the kings before him, continuing in the idolatrous sins of Jeroboam. He is succeeded by his son, Ahab, who surpasses even his father in wickedness. Ahab marries Jezebel, the daughter of the king of the Sidonians, and begins to serve and worship Baal. He builds a temple and an altar for Baal in the new capital of Samaria and also makes an Asherah pole. The chapter concludes by noting that during Ahab's reign, a man named Hiel of Bethel rebuilds the city of Jericho, and in fulfillment of the ancient curse pronounced by Joshua, he lays its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son and sets up its gates at the cost of his youngest son.

## 1 Kings 17: Elijah and the Widow of Zarephath

The narrative now shifts its focus to the prophet Elijah the Tishbite, who emerges to challenge the apostasy of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. Elijah appears before Ahab and declares that, according to his word, there will be neither dew nor rain in the land for the next few years. This drought is a direct challenge to Baal, the Canaanite god of rain and fertility. The Lord then directs Elijah to hide by the Kerith Ravine, where he is miraculously fed by ravens, who bring him bread and meat, and he drinks from the brook.

When the brook dries up because of the drought, the Lord sends Elijah to a town called Zarephath, in the region of Sidon—the heart of Baal worship and Jezebel's homeland. There, he meets a widow whom the Lord has commanded to supply him with food. The widow, however, is destitute; she has only a handful of flour and a little olive oil, just enough to make one last meal for herself and her son before they die. Elijah assures her that if she makes a small loaf of bread for him first, her jar of flour will not be used up and her jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain. The widow has faith and obeys, and the miracle occurs as promised. Later, the widow's son becomes ill and dies. The distraught mother cries out to Elijah, but the prophet takes the boy, carries him to his own room, and prays earnestly to the Lord. He stretches himself out on the boy three times, and the Lord hears his prayer, and the boy's life returns. The woman's faith is confirmed, and she declares, "Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth."

## 1 Kings 18: The Contest on Mount Carmel

After three years of drought, the Lord commands Elijah to present himself to King Ahab, for He is about to send rain. The famine is severe in Samaria, and Ahab and his palace administrator, a devout believer named Obadiah, have divided the land between them to search for grass to keep their horses and mules alive. As Obadiah is on his way, he meets Elijah. Elijah tells him to go and tell Ahab that he is here. Obadiah is terrified, fearing that the Spirit of the Lord will whisk Elijah away and that Ahab will kill him when he cannot be found. After Elijah reassures him, Obadiah goes and tells Ahab, who comes to meet the prophet.

Ahab greets Elijah as the "troubler of Israel," but Elijah retorts that it is Ahab and his family who have troubled Israel by forsaking the Lord's commands and following the Baals. Elijah then proposes a dramatic showdown on Mount Carmel. He challenges Ahab to gather all the people of Israel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who are supported by Queen Jezebel. On the mountain, Elijah confronts the people for their wavering faith, asking, "How long will ye halt between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him." He proposes a test: two bulls are to be prepared for sacrifice, one for the prophets of Baal and one for himself. They will call on the name of their respective gods, and "the God that answereth by fire, let him be God." The people agree. The prophets of Baal go first, crying out to their god from morning until noon, dancing and gashing themselves with swords, but there is no response. Elijah mocks them mercilessly. Then, in the evening, Elijah prepares his altar, drenching it and the sacrifice with twelve large jars of water. He offers a simple, powerful prayer, and the fire of the Lord falls from heaven, consuming the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the soil, and even the water in the trench. The people fall on their faces, crying, "The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God." Elijah then commands the people to seize the prophets of Baal, and he takes them down to the Kishon Valley and slaughters them. Afterward, Elijah tells Ahab to go and eat, for there is the sound of a heavy rain. Elijah goes to the top of Mount Carmel and prays, and soon a great rainstorm begins, ending the drought.

## 1 Kings 19: Elijah's Flight to Horeb

When Ahab tells his wife Jezebel everything that Elijah has done, including the execution of her prophets, she is enraged. She sends a messenger to Elijah with a death threat, vowing that by this time tomorrow, he will be as dead as one of them. Elijah, who had just stood fearlessly against 850 false prophets, is now terrified for his life. He flees into the wilderness, where he sits down under a broom tree, exhausted and despairing, and prays that he might die. He falls asleep, but an angel wakes him and provides him with a cake of bread baked on hot coals and a jar of water. Strengthened by the food, he travels for forty days and forty nights until he reaches Horeb (Mount Sinai), the mountain of God.

There, he takes shelter in a cave, and the word of the Lord comes to him, asking, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" Elijah pours out his complaint, saying that he has been very zealous for the Lord, but the Israelites have rejected the covenant, torn down the altars, and killed the prophets, and he alone is left, and now they are trying to kill him too. The Lord commands him to go and stand on the mountain, for He is about to pass by. A powerful wind, an earthquake, and a fire all pass by, but the Lord is not in any of them. After the fire comes a "still small voice." When Elijah hears it, he pulls his cloak over his face and stands at the entrance of the cave. The Lord asks him the same question again, and Elijah gives the same answer. The Lord then gives Elijah a new set of instructions, sending him back into the world of political and spiritual conflict. He is to anoint Hazael as king over Aram, Jehu as king over Israel, and Elisha as his own successor. The Lord assures him that there is still a remnant of 7,000 in Israel who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Elijah departs and finds Elisha plowing a field. He throws his cloak around Elisha, a symbolic act of calling him to be his successor. Elisha says goodbye to his family, slaughters his oxen, and follows Elijah as his attendant.

## 1 Kings 20: Ahab's Wars with Aram

Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram (Syria), musters his entire army and, with thirty-two allied kings, besieges Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. He sends an arrogant demand to King Ahab, claiming his silver, gold, wives, and children. Ahab initially agrees, but when Ben-Hadad sends a second, even more demanding message, threatening to plunder the city, Ahab's advisors urge him to resist. A prophet comes to Ahab and delivers a message from the Lord: God will deliver the vast Aramean army into Ahab's hand, so that he will know that the Lord is God. Following the prophet's instructions, Ahab launches a surprise attack with a small force, and the Arameans are routed.

The Aramean advisors convince Ben-Hadad that they lost because the God of Israel is a god of the hills; if they fight on the plain, they will surely win. The next year, the Arameans return with a reorganized army and camp on the plain. The Israelite army, which looks like two small flocks of goats in comparison, camps opposite them. The same prophet comes to Ahab again and declares that because the Arameans have said the Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys, the Lord will deliver their army into Israel's hands. After a seven-day standoff, the battle is joined, and the Israelites inflict a massive defeat on the Arameans. Ben-Hadad escapes and hides in the city. His advisors suggest he throw himself on the mercy of the king of Israel. Ben-Hadad's servants go to Ahab in sackcloth and ropes, and Ahab, in a foolish act of misplaced mercy, not only spares Ben-Hadad but also makes a treaty with him, calling him "my brother." Another prophet then confronts Ahab, using a dramatic object lesson to deliver a message of judgment. Because Ahab has let go the man whom God had devoted to destruction, his life will be forfeit for Ben-Hadad's life, and his people for Ben-Hadad's people. Ahab returns to his palace, sullen and angry.

## 1 Kings 21: Naboth's Vineyard

This chapter recounts one of the most infamous episodes of Ahab's reign. Ahab desires to acquire a vineyard that belongs to a man named Naboth the Jezreelite, because it is conveniently located next to his palace in Jezreel. He offers to either buy it or trade it for a better vineyard. Naboth, however, refuses to sell, stating, "The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee." He is standing on the principle that ancestral land, a sacred inheritance from the Lord, should not be permanently sold. Ahab returns to his palace, sullen and angry, and lies on his bed, refusing to eat.

His wicked wife, Queen Jezebel, finds him pouting and scoffs at his weakness. She tells him to get up and eat, for she will get him the vineyard. Jezebel then orchestrates a wicked plot. She writes letters in Ahab's name, sealed with his seal, to the elders of Naboth's city, instructing them to proclaim a fast and to hire two scoundrels to falsely accuse Naboth of cursing both God and the king. The elders carry out her instructions. Naboth is falsely accused, dragged out of the city, and stoned to death. When Jezebel hears that Naboth is dead, she tells Ahab to go and take possession of the vineyard. As Ahab is going down to the vineyard, the Lord sends the prophet Elijah to confront him. Elijah meets him there and delivers a devastating prophecy of judgment. He asks, "Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?" He declares that in the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up Ahab's blood. He also prophesies that God will bring disaster on Ahab's house and will wipe out his dynasty, and that dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. When Ahab hears these words, he humbles himself, tearing his clothes, putting on sackcloth, and fasting. Because of his repentance, the Lord tells Elijah that He will not bring the disaster in Ahab's day but will bring it upon his house in the days of his son.

## 1 Kings 22: The Death of Ahab

After three years of peace between Aram and Israel, Jehoshaphat, the righteous king of Judah, comes to visit King Ahab of Israel. Ahab proposes a joint military campaign to recapture the city of Ramoth Gilead from the Arameans. Jehoshaphat agrees but insists that they first inquire of the word of the Lord. Ahab gathers his 400 court prophets, who all unanimously predict victory. Jehoshaphat, however, is skeptical and asks if there is not another prophet of the Lord they can consult. Ahab reluctantly admits there is one, Micaiah son of Imlah, but he hates him because he never prophesies anything good about him, only bad.

Micaiah is summoned and is initially pressured to give a favorable prophecy. He sarcastically tells Ahab to go and be victorious. When Ahab presses him to tell the truth, Micaiah reveals a vision he has seen: all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. He also describes a scene in the heavenly council where the Lord has allowed a lying spirit to enter the mouths of all of Ahab's prophets to entice him to his doom. In response, one of the false prophets slaps Micaiah, and Ahab orders him to be thrown in prison. Despite the dire warning, Ahab and Jehoshaphat proceed with the battle. Ahab disguises himself, but a soldier from the Aramean army draws his bow at random and hits the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The mortally wounded Ahab remains propped up in his chariot, and he dies at evening. His body is brought back to Samaria, and when his chariot is washed at a pool, the dogs lick up his blood, just as the prophet Elijah had foretold. The chapter concludes with a brief summary of the reigns of Jehoshaphat in Judah and Ahaziah, Ahab's wicked son and successor, in Israel.
