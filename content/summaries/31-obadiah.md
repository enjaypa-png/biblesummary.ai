## Obadiah 1: Judgment on Edom and the Day of the Lord

The vision of Obadiah begins with a message from the Lord GOD concerning Edom. A report goes out among the nations, calling them to rise up against Edom for battle. The Lord declares that Edom is made small among the nations and deeply despised. Edom lives in the clefts of the rock and sets its dwelling high, saying in its heart that no one can bring it down. The Lord answers that even if Edom rises like an eagle and sets its nest among the stars, He will bring it down. Thieves and grape gatherers leave something behind, but Esau is searched out completely and his hidden things are uncovered. His allies deceive him, and those at peace with him lay a trap. The wise men of Edom and the understanding of mount Esau are cut off, and the mighty men of Teman are dismayed.

Violence against Jacob, Edom's brother, brings shame and destruction. Edom stands on the other side when strangers carry away Jerusalem's wealth and foreigners enter its gates. Edom rejoices over the children of Judah in their day of ruin, speaks proudly, enters the gate of God's people in their calamity, and lays hands on their substance. They stand at the crossroads to cut off those who escape and deliver up survivors in the day of distress. The day of the LORD is near upon all nations, and as Edom has done, it is done to them. Deliverance comes upon mount Zion, and the house of Jacob possesses its possessions. The house of Jacob becomes a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble. The captivity of Israel returns and possesses the land, and saviors come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau. The kingdom belongs to the LORD.
