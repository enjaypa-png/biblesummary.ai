# Micah

## Micah 1: Judgment Against Samaria and Judah

The word of the Lord comes to Micah the Morasthite during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He speaks concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. The Lord calls all people of the earth to listen as He rises from His holy temple to witness against His people. The mountains melt under Him and the valleys split apart because of the sins of Jacob and the rebellion of the house of Israel. Samaria becomes a heap in the field, and her carved images are broken and burned.

Micah mourns and cries out, saying he will walk barefoot and stripped in grief. He compares his mourning to the howling of jackals and the sorrow of ostriches. He says the wound of Samaria is incurable and spreads to Judah, even reaching the gate of Jerusalem. He names towns such as Gath, Beth-le-aphrah, Shaphir, Zaanan, and others, describing shame, loss, and captivity that overtake them. He tells the people to shave their heads in grief for their children, because they go into exile.

## Micah 2: Woe to the Oppressors and False Prophets

Micah speaks against those who plan evil on their beds and carry it out at daylight because it is in their power to do so. They covet fields and houses and take them by violence, oppressing a man and his family. The Lord says He plans disaster against this family from which they cannot remove their necks. He declares that their land will be divided and given to others. False prophets tell Micah not to prophesy such things, claiming disgrace will not come.

Micah responds that the Spirit of the Lord is not limited and that His words do good to those who walk uprightly. He accuses the people of rising as enemies, taking garments from the peaceful and casting women out of their pleasant houses. He tells them to arise and depart because the land is polluted and will destroy them. He describes prophets who speak of wine and strong drink as the kind the people prefer. The Lord promises to gather the remnant of Israel, assemble them like sheep in a fold, and lead them out with their King going before them.

## Micah 3: Rulers and Prophets Who Pervert Justice

Micah addresses the heads of Jacob and the princes of Israel, asking if they should not know judgment. He says they hate good and love evil, tearing the skin from the people and breaking their bones like meat for a pot. When they cry to the Lord, He does not answer them because of their evil deeds. He speaks against prophets who cause the people to err, promising peace when they are fed but declaring war against those who do not satisfy them.

Micah says night comes upon these prophets so they have no vision. The sun goes down over them, and they are ashamed because there is no answer from God. In contrast, Micah says he is filled with power by the Spirit of the Lord to declare Jacob's transgression and Israel's sin. He accuses leaders of building Zion with blood and Jerusalem with injustice. Priests teach for payment and prophets divine for money, yet they lean on the Lord and say no harm will come. Because of them, Zion is plowed like a field, Jerusalem becomes heaps, and the mountain of the house becomes like the high places of a forest.

## Micah 4: The Mountain of the Lord and Zion's Restoration

Micah describes the mountain of the house of the Lord established in the last days, exalted above the hills. Many nations come and say they will go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, so He may teach them His ways. The law goes forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He judges among many people and rebukes strong nations far off. They beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks, and they do not learn war anymore.

Every man sits under his vine and fig tree without fear. Though other nations walk in the name of their gods, Israel walks in the name of the Lord. The Lord gathers the lame, the driven out, and the afflicted, making them a strong nation. He reigns over them in mount Zion from that time forward. Micah speaks of Zion crying out in pain like a woman in labor and going to Babylon, where she is delivered. Many nations gather against her, but the Lord gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor, and Zion rises to beat them in pieces.

## Micah 5: The Ruler from Bethlehem

Micah calls the daughter of troops to gather herself as enemies lay siege against her. He speaks of a ruler in Israel who comes from Bethlehem Ephratah, whose origins are from ancient days. This ruler stands and feeds the flock in the strength of the Lord and is great to the ends of the earth. When the Assyrian enters the land, leaders are raised against him, and the land of Assyria is laid waste with the sword.

The remnant of Jacob is among many people like dew from the Lord and like a lion among beasts. Their hand is lifted against adversaries, and enemies are cut off. The Lord says He cuts off horses and destroys chariots, strongholds, and cities. He removes witchcrafts and soothsayers, graven images and standing images, so the people no longer worship the work of their hands. He executes vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations that do not obey.

## Micah 6: What the Lord Requires

The Lord calls Israel to rise and contend before the mountains, asking what He has done to weary them. He reminds them that He brought them up from Egypt and redeemed them from the house of bondage, sending Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before them. He recalls how Balak king of Moab consulted Balaam the son of Beor, and how the Lord turned the matter. The people ask what they should bring before the Lord—burnt offerings, calves, thousands of rams, or rivers of oil.

Micah declares that the Lord has shown what is good: to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. The voice of the Lord cries to the city, warning of the rod and who appoints it. He speaks of wicked balances, deceitful weights, and violent rich men. Because of their sins, they eat but are not satisfied, sow but do not reap, tread olives but do not anoint themselves. They keep the statutes of Omri and the works of the house of Ahab, so the Lord makes them a desolation and a hissing.

## Micah 7: Lament and Hope in God's Mercy

Micah laments that he is like one who gathers summer fruit and finds no cluster to eat. The faithful man perishes from the earth, and there is no upright person among men. They all lie in wait for blood, and even leaders and judges ask for rewards. A son dishonors his father, a daughter rises against her mother, and a man's enemies are those of his own house.

Micah says he looks to the Lord and waits for the God of his salvation. He tells his enemy not to rejoice when he falls, because when he sits in darkness, the Lord is light to him. He bears the Lord's indignation because he has sinned, until the Lord pleads his cause and executes judgment for him. Nations see and are ashamed of their might. The Lord feeds His people like a shepherd and shows marvelous things as in the days of Egypt. Micah ends by declaring that there is no God like the Lord, who pardons iniquity, passes over transgression, does not retain anger forever, and casts sins into the depths of the sea, performing the truth promised to Jacob and the mercy promised to Abraham.
