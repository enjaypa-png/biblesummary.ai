# Exodus

## 1: Israel's Oppression in Egypt

The book of Exodus begins by listing the descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt. After Joseph and his generation die, the Israelite population grows so numerous that a new Pharaoh, who does not know of Joseph, becomes alarmed. Fearing the Israelites might side with Egypt's enemies in a time of war, he enslaves them and forces them into hard labor, building the treasure cities of Pithom and Raamses. Despite the harsh conditions, the Israelites continue to multiply. Pharaoh then commands the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to kill all newborn Hebrew boys, but they fear God and disobey the order. When Pharaoh questions them, they claim the Hebrew women give birth too quickly for them to intervene. As a result, God blesses the midwives, and the Israelites continue to grow in number. Frustrated, Pharaoh commands all his people to throw every newborn Hebrew boy into the Nile River.

## 2: The Birth and Early Life of Moses

A Levite man and woman have a son, and when his mother can no longer hide him, she places him in a waterproof basket among the reeds of the Nile. The baby's sister watches from a distance to see what will happen. Pharaoh's daughter discovers the baby while bathing and, affected by the child's cries, recognizes him as a Hebrew. The baby's sister then offers to find a Hebrew woman to nurse the child, and she brings the baby's own mother. Pharaoh's daughter pays the mother to nurse the child, and when he is older, he is brought to Pharaoh's daughter and becomes her son. She names him Moses, meaning "drawn out," because she drew him out of the water. As an adult, Moses sees an Egyptian beating a Hebrew and, after ensuring no one is watching, kills the Egyptian and buries him in the sand. The next day, he sees two Hebrews fighting and tries to intervene, but one of them reveals that Moses's killing of the Egyptian is known. Fearing for his life, Moses flees to Midian, where he helps the seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, water their flock. He marries one of the daughters, Zipporah, who bears him a son named Gershom. Meanwhile, the king of Egypt dies, but the Israelites' suffering continues, and their cries for help reach God.

## 3: The Burning Bush

While tending his father-in-law's flock, Moses leads the sheep to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God. There, the angel of the Lord appears to him in a burning bush that is not consumed by the flames. When Moses turns to investigate, God calls to him from the bush, telling him to remove his sandals because he is standing on holy ground. God identifies Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses hides his face in fear. God declares that He has seen the suffering of His people in Egypt and intends to deliver them and bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey. He commissions Moses to go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses expresses doubt about his own abilities, but God promises to be with him. When Moses asks for God's name to tell the Israelites, God replies, "I Am That I Am," and instructs Moses to say that "I Am" has sent him. God also tells Moses to gather the elders of Israel and inform them of His promise of deliverance. He warns that the king of Egypt will not let them go easily, but after God performs great wonders, they will be released.

## 4: Moses's Return to Egypt

Moses expresses his fear that the Israelites will not believe him. In response, God gives him three signs to perform: his staff will turn into a serpent and back again, his hand will become leprous and then be healed, and water from the Nile will turn to blood when poured on the ground. Moses then objects that he is not an eloquent speaker, but God reminds him that He is the one who created man's mouth. God appoints Moses's brother, Aaron, who is a good speaker, to be his spokesman. Moses takes his wife and sons and, with the staff of God in his hand, begins his journey back to Egypt. Along the way, the Lord meets him and seeks to kill him, but Zipporah circumcises their son, saving Moses's life. Moses meets Aaron in the wilderness, and together they go to the elders of Israel. Aaron performs the signs God had given Moses, and the people believe and worship God.

## 5: The First Encounter with Pharaoh

Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh and deliver God's message: "Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness." Pharaoh dismisses their request, asking, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?" He accuses Moses and Aaron of distracting the people from their work. That same day, Pharaoh increased the Israelites' burdens, ordering his taskmasters to no longer provide straw for their brick-making. The people are now required to gather their own straw while still producing the same number of bricks. The Israelite foremen are beaten when they fail to meet the quota. They cry out to Pharaoh, who rebukes them for being idle. The foremen then confront Moses and Aaron, blaming them for their increased suffering. Moses, in turn, questions God, asking why He has sent him, since his intervention has only made things worse for the people.

## 6: God's Promise of Deliverance

God reassures Moses, promising to deliver the Israelites from their bondage with a mighty hand. He reveals His covenant name, Jehovah (or Yahweh), which was not fully known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God reiterates His promise to bring the Israelites into the land of Canaan. Moses conveys this message to the Israelites, but they are too discouraged and broken in spirit to listen. God then commands Moses to go back to Pharaoh and demand the release of the Israelites. Moses again expresses his inadequacy, questioning why Pharaoh would listen to him when even the Israelites will not. The chapter concludes with a genealogy of the heads of the houses of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, establishing the lineage of Moses and Aaron.

## 7: The First Plague: Water to Blood

God once again commissions Moses and Aaron to confront Pharaoh, appointing Moses as "a god to Pharaoh" and Aaron as his prophet. God warns that He will harden Pharaoh's heart so that He can multiply His signs and wonders in Egypt. Moses is eighty years old, and Aaron is eighty-three when they speak to Pharaoh. When Pharaoh demands a miracle, Aaron throws down his staff, and it becomes a serpent. Pharaoh's magicians imitate the feat with their own enchantments, but Aaron's staff swallows theirs. Nevertheless, Pharaoh's heart remains hard. God then instructs Moses to meet Pharaoh at the Nile in the morning. There, Aaron strikes the water with his staff, and all the water in the river, as well as in the streams, ponds, and reservoirs throughout Egypt, turns to blood. The fish die, the river stinks, and the Egyptians cannot drink the water. Pharaoh's magicians replicate this plague with their own secret arts, and Pharaoh remains unmoved, returning to his palace. The Egyptians are forced to dig for drinking water, and the plague lasts for seven days.

## 8: The Plagues of Frogs, Lice, and Flies

In Exodus 8, the Lord sends Moses to warn Pharaoh to let Israel go, threatening a plague of frogs if he refuses. Moses' brother Aaron stretches out his hand with the rod over the waters of Egypt, and frogs come up and cover the land, entering houses, chambers, and ovens; the magicians also bring up frogs by their enchantments. Pharaoh calls for Moses and Aaron and begs them to entreat the Lord to remove the frogs, promising to let the people go, and Moses allows Pharaoh to set the time when the frogs will be taken away; at the appointed time the frogs die, are gathered into heaps, and the land stinks, yet when Pharaoh sees there is respite, he hardens his heart and will not listen, just as the Lord had said. Then the Lord commands Moses to tell his brother Aaron to stretch out his rod and smite the dust of the land, and it becomes lice on man and beast throughout Egypt; the magicians try to do likewise but cannot, and they confess, "This is the finger of God," yet Pharaoh's heart remains hardened and he does not hearken to them. After this, the Lord warns Pharaoh of grievous swarms of flies and declares He will set apart the land of Goshen, where His people dwell, so that no flies will be there, to show the difference between His people and the Egyptians. Thick swarms of flies fill Pharaoh's house and the land of Egypt, so Pharaoh calls Moses and Aaron and first offers that Israel sacrifice in the land; Moses insists they must go three days' journey into the wilderness, and Pharaoh agrees they may go, but not very far, and asks Moses again to entreat the Lord. Moses prays, and the Lord removes the flies so that not one remains, but Pharaoh hardens his heart at this time also and still refuses to let Israel go.

## 9: The Plagues on Livestock, Boils, and Hail

The fifth plague is a pestilence that strikes the livestock of the Egyptians, killing their horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, and sheep. However, the livestock of the Israelites in Goshen are completely spared. Despite seeing this clear distinction, Pharaoh's heart remains hard. For the sixth plague, God instructs Moses and Aaron to take handfuls of soot from a furnace and toss it into the air in Pharaoh's presence. The soot becomes a fine dust that causes festering boils to break out on the Egyptians and their animals. The magicians are so afflicted that they cannot even stand before Moses. God again hardens Pharaoh's heart. For the seventh plague, God sends a devastating hailstorm, accompanied by thunder and fire. God warns Pharaoh to bring his livestock and servants indoors, and those who fear the Lord do so. The hail strikes down everything in the fields throughout Egypt—people, animals, and plants—except in the land of Goshen. Pharaoh summons Moses and Aaron, confesses his sin, and promises to let the people go. But when Moses prays and the storm ceases, Pharaoh and his officials harden their hearts once more.

## 10: The Plagues of Locusts and Darkness

God sends Moses to Pharaoh to announce the eighth plague: locusts. Moses warns that the locusts will cover the land and devour everything that was left after the hailstorm. Pharaoh's officials, seeing that Egypt is on the brink of ruin, urge him to let the Israelite men go. Pharaoh calls Moses and Aaron back and offers to let the men go, but not the women and children. Moses refuses this offer, and he and Aaron are driven from Pharaoh's presence. Moses then stretches out his staff, and a powerful east wind brings a swarm of locusts that blankets the land, devouring every plant and tree until nothing green remains. A terrified Pharaoh summons Moses and Aaron, confesses his sin, and begs them to pray for the removal of the locusts. God sends a strong west wind that blows the locusts into the Red Sea. However, God hardens Pharaoh's heart again, and he refuses to let the people go. For the ninth plague, God instructs Moses to stretch his hand toward the sky, and a thick, tangible darkness covers Egypt for three days. The Egyptians cannot see one another or move from their places, but the Israelites have light in their dwellings. Pharaoh calls for Moses and agrees to let the people go, but insists that their flocks and herds must remain. Moses refuses, stating that they need the animals for sacrifices. Enraged, Pharaoh banishes Moses, threatening him with death if he ever sees his face again. Moses agrees that he will not see Pharaoh's face again.

## 11: The Final Plague Announced

God reveals to Moses that He will bring one final plague upon Egypt, after which Pharaoh will not only let the Israelites go but will drive them out completely. God instructs Moses to have the Israelites ask their Egyptian neighbors for articles of silver and gold, and God gives the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moses himself is held in high regard by Pharaoh's officials and the Egyptian people. Moses then goes to Pharaoh and announces the final plague: at midnight, God will pass through Egypt, and every firstborn son in the land will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the lowest servant, as well as the firstborn of all the livestock. A great cry will rise up in Egypt, but among the Israelites, not even a dog will bark, so that the Egyptians will know that God distinguishes between them and Israel. Moses declares that after this, Pharaoh's own officials will come and beg him and the Israelites to leave. Moses then leaves Pharaoh's presence in great anger. God tells Moses that Pharaoh will not listen, so that His wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.

## 12: The First Passover and the Exodus

God establishes the Passover ritual for the Israelites. On the tenth day of the first month, each household is to take a year-old male lamb without blemish. On the fourteenth day, they are to slaughter the lambs at twilight. They are to apply some of the blood to the doorposts and lintels of their homes and eat the roasted meat that night with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, dressed and ready to leave. The blood on the doorposts will be a sign for the death angel to "pass over" their homes and spare their firstborn. At midnight, the Lord strikes down every firstborn in Egypt, from the son of Pharaoh to the son of the prisoner in the dungeon, as well as the firstborn of the livestock. A loud cry of anguish fills Egypt, for there is not a house without someone dead. That night, Pharaoh summons Moses and Aaron and tells them to take the Israelites and their flocks and herds and leave. The Egyptians urge the Israelites to leave quickly, giving them the silver, gold, and clothing they had requested. About 600,000 Israelite men, plus women and children, depart from Rameses to Succoth, beginning their exodus from Egypt after 430 years of residence. God gives further instructions about the Passover, stating that it is to be a permanent ordinance and that no foreigner may eat of it unless he is circumcised.

## 13: Consecration of the Firstborn

In Exodus 13, the Lord commands Moses after their deliverance to consecrate—meaning set apart as holy and dedicate wholly to Him—every firstborn male among the children of Israel, both of man and beast, as a perpetual memorial that He spared their firstborn while smiting Egypt's during Passover. Moses charges the people to remember this day by keeping the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days, with no leaven seen in all their quarters, for it shall be as a sign upon their hand and as a memorial between their eyes that the Lord brought them out of Egypt by strength of hand; diligently teach your children its meaning, as the ordinance of the Lord, to be observed when entering the land. The Lord does not lead Israel by the way of the land of the Philistines, though nearer, lest they face war and return to Egypt; instead, God brings them out of the wilderness toward the Red Sea, and Moses takes Joseph's bones with him as sworn. By day the Lord goes before them in a pillar of cloud to lead, and by night in a pillar of fire to give light, so they may journey day and night; neither pillar departs from before the people.

## 14: Crossing the Red Sea

God instructs Moses to have the Israelites turn back and camp by the sea, so that Pharaoh will think they are lost and wandering in the desert. God declares that He will harden Pharaoh's heart one last time so that He will be honored through Pharaoh and his army. Pharaoh, regretting his decision to let the Israelites go, pursues them with his entire army, including 600 of his best chariots, and overtakes them as they are camped by the Red Sea. When the Israelites see the Egyptian army approaching, they are terrified and cry out to the Lord, accusing Moses of bringing them into the wilderness to die. Moses reassures them, telling them to stand firm and see the deliverance of the Lord. God commands Moses to lift up his staff and stretch his hand over the sea to divide it. As he does, a strong east wind blows all night, turning the sea into dry land with a wall of water on either side. The Israelites cross through the sea on dry ground. The Egyptian army follows them into the sea, but God clogs their chariot wheels, throwing them into a panic. As morning approaches, God commands Moses to stretch his hand over the sea again, and the waters return to their normal course, covering the entire Egyptian army. Not one of them survives. On that day, the Israelites see the great power of the Lord, and they put their faith in Him and in His servant Moses.

## 15: The Song of Moses and Miriam

After the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, Moses and the Israelites sing a song of praise to the Lord, celebrating His triumph over the Egyptian army. The song extols God as their strength, song, and salvation, a warrior who has shattered the enemy. It describes how the waters covered the chariots and horsemen, who sank to the depths like a stone. The song also looks forward to the future, proclaiming that the fear of God will fall upon the nations of Canaan, and that God will bring His people to the mountain of His inheritance, the sanctuary He has established. Miriam, the prophetess and sister of Aaron, takes a tambourine and leads the women in dancing and singing, echoing the refrain of the song: "Sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea." After their celebration, the Israelites travel for three days in the Desert of Shur without finding water. They come to a place called Marah, but the water there is bitter. The people grumble against Moses, who cries out to the Lord. God shows him a piece of wood, which he throws into the water, and the water becomes sweet. There, God makes a decree and a law for them, promising that if they listen to His voice and do what is right, He will not bring upon them any of the diseases He brought upon the Egyptians.

## 16: Manna and Quail

The Israelite community arrives in the Desert of Sin, and once again, they grumble against Moses and Aaron, complaining that they would have been better off to die in Egypt, where they had plenty of food. God tells Moses that He will rain down bread from heaven for them. The people are to gather a daily portion each day, with a double portion on the sixth day to prepare for the Sabbath, when no work is to be done. That evening, a flock of quail comes and covers the camp, providing meat for the people. In the morning, a layer of dew around the camp leaves behind a thin, flaky substance on the ground. The Israelites do not know what it is, so they call it "manna" (meaning "What is it?"). Moses instructs them to gather an omer (about two quarts) for each person and not to leave any of it overnight. Some disobey and try to save it, but it becomes wormy and foul. On the sixth day, they gather a double portion, and it remains fresh for the Sabbath. A jar of manna is to be kept for future generations as a reminder of how God provided for them in the wilderness. The Israelites eat manna for forty years, until they reach the border of Canaan.

## 17: Water from the Rock and Battle with the Amalekites

The Israelites continue their journey and camp at Rephidim, but there is no water to drink. The people quarrel with Moses, demanding water and accusing him of bringing them out of Egypt to die of thirst. Moses cries out to the Lord, who instructs him to take some of the elders and his staff and go to a rock at Horeb. There, Moses is to strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink. Moses does so, and he names the place Massah (testing) and Meribah (quarreling) because the Israelites tested the Lord by asking, "Is the Lord among us or not?" While they are at Rephidim, the Amalekites come and attack the Israelites. Moses orders Joshua to choose men and go out to fight them. The next day, Moses stands on top of a hill with the staff of God in his hands. As long as Moses holds up his hands, the Israelites are winning, but whenever he lowers his hands, the Amalekites gain the upper hand. When Moses's arms grow tired, Aaron and Hur have him sit on a stone and they hold up his hands, one on each side, until sunset. Joshua and his army defeat the Amalekites. The Lord commands Moses to write about the battle in a scroll as a memorial and to ensure that Joshua hears it, for God will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Moses builds an altar and calls it "The Lord is my Banner."

## 18: Jethro's Advice

Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, hears about all that God has done for Moses and the Israelites. He travels to the Israelite camp at the mountain of God, bringing with him Moses's wife, Zipporah, and their two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. Moses goes out to meet Jethro, and they greet each other warmly. Moses tells his father-in-law everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and Jethro rejoices. He offers a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and he, Aaron, and all the elders of Israel eat a meal together in God's presence. The next day, Jethro observes Moses sitting as a judge for the people from morning until evening. He tells Moses that what he is doing is not good, as he will wear himself out and the people as well. Jethro advises Moses to appoint capable, God-fearing men to serve as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. These men can handle the simple cases, while only the most difficult cases would be brought to Moses. Moses listens to his father-in-law's advice and implements this system of delegated authority, which greatly eases his burden. Afterward, Jethro returns to his own country.

## 19: Israel at Mount Sinai

Three months after leaving Egypt, the Israelites arrive at the Desert of Sinai and camp before the mountain. Moses goes up the mountain to God, and the Lord calls to him, telling him to remind the Israelites how He carried them on eagles' wings and brought them to Himself. God declares that if they obey Him fully and keep His covenant, they will be His treasured possession out of all nations, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Moses returns and relays God's message to the people, and they respond in unison, "We will do everything the Lord has said." God then tells Moses to have the people consecrate themselves, for in three days the Lord will descend upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. He warns that no one, not even an animal, is to touch the mountain, on pain of death. On the morning of the third day, there is thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. The people tremble in the camp. Moses leads them out to meet with God, and the mountain is covered in smoke because the Lord has descended upon it in fire. The trumpet blast grows louder, and Moses speaks, and God answers him with thunder. The Lord calls Moses to the top of the mountain and again warns him not to let the priests or the people force their way up, lest the Lord break out against them.

## 20: The Ten Commandments

God speaks all the words of the Ten Commandments to the people of Israel from the top of Mount Sinai. The first four commandments concern their relationship with God: they are to have no other gods before Him, not make any idols, not misuse the name of the Lord, and remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. The remaining six commandments concern their relationships with one another: they are to honor their father and mother, not murder, not commit adultery, not steal, not give false testimony, and not covet their neighbor's possessions. When the people witness the thunder, lightning, trumpet sound, and smoking mountain, they are terrified and stay at a distance. They ask Moses to speak to them instead of God, for they fear they will die. Moses reassures them, explaining that God has come to test them, so that the fear of God will keep them from sinning. After the Ten Commandments are given, God gives Moses additional laws concerning worship. He commands that any altar made for Him must be of earth or uncut stones, for to shape them with a tool would defile them. He also forbids the use of steps to approach the altar, to prevent any indecent exposure.

## 21: Laws Concerning Personal Injury

God gives Moses a series of laws, often referred to as the Book of the Covenant, that provide a framework for justice and social order in Israel. This chapter focuses on laws concerning personal injury and restitution. It begins with regulations for Hebrew servants, who are to serve for six years and be set free in the seventh. It then addresses various scenarios of violence and harm. The penalty for murder is death, but a distinction is made for unintentional killing, for which cities of refuge are to be established. The chapter outlines specific "eye for an eye" punishments for injuries, where the penalty is to match the harm done. For example, if a pregnant woman is injured and gives birth prematurely, the one who caused the injury must pay a fine, but if there is serious injury, the penalty is life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The chapter also covers injuries caused by animals, such as an ox that gores a person to death. If the owner knew the ox was dangerous, both the ox and the owner are to be put to death, though the owner may be able to pay a ransom instead. These laws establish a principle of accountability and seek to ensure that justice is carried out fairly and proportionately.

## 22: Laws Concerning Property and Restitution

This chapter continues the legal code with a focus on laws concerning property, theft, and restitution. If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is killed, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed, but if it happens during the day, they are. A thief must make restitution; if they steal an ox, they must pay back five oxen, and for a sheep, four sheep. If the stolen animal is found alive in their possession, they must pay back double. The chapter also covers damages caused by livestock grazing in another's field and fires that spread to a neighbor's property; in both cases, the responsible party must make restitution from the best of their own produce or property. Laws are given regarding property entrusted to a neighbor for safekeeping. If it is stolen, the thief, if found, must pay double. If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine if he has stolen the goods himself. The chapter also includes laws against seducing a virgin (the man must pay the bride-price and marry her), practicing sorcery (a sorceress is not to be allowed to live), and bestiality (punishable by death). It concludes with laws demanding justice for foreigners, widows, and orphans, and forbidding the charging of interest on loans to the poor.

## 23: Laws of Justice and Mercy

This chapter continues with laws that emphasize justice, mercy, and the proper observance of religious festivals. It commands the Israelites not to spread false reports or conspire with the wicked to give false testimony. They are not to follow the crowd in doing wrong or show favoritism in a lawsuit, whether to the poor or the great. The chapter includes laws of compassion, such as helping an enemy's donkey if it has fallen under its load. It strongly prohibits accepting bribes and oppressing foreigners, reminding the Israelites that they too were once foreigners in Egypt. The chapter then outlines the observance of the Sabbath year, during which the land is to lie fallow every seventh year, and the weekly Sabbath, a day of rest for everyone, including servants and animals. Three annual festivals are established: the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Harvest (Pentecost), and the Feast of Ingathering (Tabernacles). The chapter concludes with God's promise to send an angel before the Israelites to guide and protect them on their way to the Promised Land. He warns them to obey the angel and not to worship the gods of the Canaanites. God promises to bless the Israelites with health, prosperity, and victory over their enemies if they remain faithful to Him.

## 24: The Covenant Is Ratified

Moses returns to the people and tells them all the Lord's words and laws. They respond with one voice, "Everything the Lord has said, we will do." The next morning, Moses builds an altar at the foot of the mountain and sets up twelve stone pillars, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. He sends young Israelite men to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord. Moses takes half of the blood from the sacrifices and sprinkles it on the altar. He then reads the Book of the Covenant to the people, and they again affirm their commitment to obey. Moses takes the other half of the blood and sprinkles it on the people, saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words." Afterward, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel go up the mountain. They see the God of Israel, who appears with a pavement of sapphire under His feet, as clear as the sky. God does not lay a hand on these leaders of Israel; they see God, and they eat and drink. The Lord then calls Moses to come further up the mountain to receive the stone tablets with the law and commandments. Moses, accompanied by his assistant Joshua, goes up the mountain of God, leaving Aaron and Hur in charge of the people. A cloud covers the mountain, and the glory of the Lord settles on Mount Sinai. Moses enters the cloud and remains on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.

## 25–31: Tabernacle Instructions

While Moses is on Mount Sinai, God provides him with detailed instructions for constructing the Tabernacle, a portable sanctuary where God will dwell among His people. The Israelites are to bring a voluntary offering of materials, including gold, silver, bronze, fine linens, and precious stones, for its construction. The instructions cover every aspect of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, as well as the garments for the priests and the rituals for their consecration. God emphasizes that everything must be made exactly according to the pattern shown to Moses on the mountain.

Key components of the Tabernacle include the Ark of the Covenant, a gold-plated wooden chest containing the testimony (the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments), with a mercy seat and two cherubim on top; the Table of Showbread, on which twelve loaves of bread are to be placed each Sabbath; and the Golden Lampstand (Menorah), which is to be kept burning continually. The Tabernacle itself is to be a tent-like structure made of a wooden frame and covered with ten curtains of fine linen, followed by layers of goats' hair, ram skins dyed red, and badger skins. A veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, where the Ark is to be kept. The instructions also detail the construction of the Altar of Burnt Offering, made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, and the Altar of Incense, overlaid with gold. The courtyard surrounding the Tabernacle is to be enclosed by curtains of fine linen. God also specifies the design of the priestly garments for Aaron and his sons, including the ephod, breastplate with twelve precious stones, robe, and turban. The section concludes with instructions for the consecration of the priests, the daily offerings, and the observance of the Sabbath as a perpetual covenant. God appoints Bezalel of the tribe of Judah and Oholiab of the tribe of Dan, filling them with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and skill in all kinds of crafts to carry out the construction.

## 32: The Golden Calf

When the people see that Moses is delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gather around Aaron and demand that he make them gods to lead them. Aaron tells them to bring him the gold earrings of their wives and children. He melts them down and fashions a golden calf, and the people declare, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." Aaron builds an altar before the calf, and the next day, the people celebrate with offerings, feasting, and revelry. God sees their corruption and, in His anger, tells Moses He will destroy them and make a great nation from Moses instead. Moses intercedes on behalf of the people, pleading with God to remember His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God relents and does not bring the disaster He had threatened. As Moses and Joshua come down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony, they hear the sound of singing. When Moses sees the golden calf and the dancing, his anger burns. He throws the stone tablets to the ground, shattering them at the foot of the mountain. He then grinds the golden calf into powder, scatters it on the water, and makes the Israelites drink it. Moses confronts Aaron, who blames the people for their evil inclinations. Moses stands at the entrance to the camp and calls for those who are on the Lord's side to join him. The Levites rally to him, and he commands them to go through the camp and kill their brothers, friends, and neighbors who were involved in the idolatry. About 3,000 people are killed that day. The next day, Moses returns to the Lord to make atonement for the people's sin, even offering to have his own name blotted out of God's book. God tells him that only those who have sinned will be blotted out and sends a plague on the people because of what they did with the calf.

## 33: Moses Intercedes for the People

God commands Moses to lead the people to the land He promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. However, He declares that He will not go with them, for they are a stiff-necked people, and His presence among them might lead to their destruction. When the people hear this distressing news, they go into mourning and remove their ornaments. Moses used to set up a tent of meeting outside the camp, and whenever he went there, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses "face to face, as a man speaks with his friend." Inside the tent, Moses pleads with God to go with them, arguing that God's presence is what distinguishes them from all other peoples on earth. He also asks to see God's glory. God agrees to go with them and promises to make all His goodness pass before Moses. However, He tells Moses that he cannot see His face, for no one can see God and live. Instead, God will place Moses in a cleft in the rock and cover him with His hand while He passes by. Moses will then be able to see God's back, but not His face.

## 34: The New Stone Tablets

God commands Moses to chisel out two new stone tablets like the first ones, so that He can write the Ten Commandments on them again. Moses does so and returns to the top of Mount Sinai. The Lord descends in a cloud and proclaims His name, passing before Moses and declaring His character: "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished." Moses bows in worship and again asks God to go with His people, despite their stiff-necked nature, and to forgive their sin. God makes a covenant with the Israelites, promising to perform wonders unlike any seen before and to drive out the inhabitants of the Promised Land. He warns them not to make any treaties with the people of the land or to worship their gods. He reiterates the commands for the three annual festivals and the Sabbath. Moses remains on the mountain with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, without eating or drinking, and he writes the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments—on the tablets. When Moses comes down from the mountain, his face is radiant because he has spoken with the Lord, but he is unaware of it. The people, including Aaron, are afraid to come near him. Moses calls them over and gives them the commands he received from God. He then puts a veil over his face, which he removes only when he goes in to speak with the Lord.

## 35–40: Tabernacle Construction

This final section of Exodus describes the construction of the Tabernacle, which the Israelites carry out exactly according to the instructions God gave to Moses. The people show great enthusiasm for the project, willingly offering an abundance of materials—so much so that Moses has to tell them to stop giving. The work is overseen by the master craftsmen Bezalel and Oholiab, whom God has specially gifted with the skills needed for the task. They and their team of artisans faithfully construct every component of the sanctuary and its furnishings.

The craftsmen build the Tabernacle's wooden frame and its elaborate system of curtains and coverings. They create the sacred furniture for the Holy Place, including the Ark of the Covenant with its mercy seat, the table for the showbread, and the golden lampstand. They also construct the bronze altar for burnt offerings, the golden altar of incense, and the bronze laver for the courtyard. The special garments for Aaron the high priest and his sons are also made as prescribed. Once all the work is finished, the components are brought to Moses, who inspects them and confirms that everything has been made according to God's command. The Tabernacle is then assembled, and when it is complete, the cloud of God's glory descends and fills it, signifying that God's presence now dwells among His people.
