# Exodus

## Exodus 1: Israel's Oppression in Egypt

The sons of Israel settle in Egypt, and their families grow rapidly until the land is filled with them. A new Pharaoh arises who does not know Joseph and fears that the Israelites will join Egypt's enemies if war comes, so he places them under harsh labor and forces them to build the store cities Pithom and Raamses. The more they are oppressed, the more they multiply, which increases Egyptian fear. Pharaoh commands the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to kill every male child at birth, but they fear God and let the boys live. When Pharaoh confronts them, they say the Hebrew women deliver before the midwives arrive, and God blesses the midwives with households. Pharaoh then commands all his people to cast every Hebrew son into the river while allowing the daughters to live.

## Exodus 2: Moses Birth and Flight to Midian

A man of the house of Levi marries a daughter of Levi, and she bears a son; seeing that he is a goodly child, she hides him three months. When she cannot hide him longer, she places him in an ark of bulrushes among the reeds of the river, and his sister Miriam stands at a distance to see what happens. Pharaoh's daughter finds the child, has compassion on him, and hires his own mother to nurse him before raising him as her son and naming him Moses, saying she draws him out of the water. When grown, Moses kills an Egyptian who strikes a Hebrew and hides the body, but the act becomes known, and Pharaoh seeks to kill him. Moses flees to Midian, defends the daughters of Jethro the priest of Midian, marries Zipporah, and has a son named Gershom. The king of Egypt dies, and the children of Israel cry out under bondage, and God hears their groaning and remembers His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## Exodus 3: The Burning Bush

Moses keeps the flock of Jethro and comes to Horeb, the mountain of God, where the angel of the Lord appears in a flame of fire from a bush that burns without being consumed. God calls to Moses from the bush, tells him to remove his shoes because the ground is holy, and declares Himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God says He has seen the affliction of His people in Egypt and will deliver them to a land flowing with milk and honey. He sends Moses to Pharaoh to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. When Moses asks for God's name, God replies, "I AM THAT I AM," and instructs him to tell the elders of Israel that the Lord has sent him and will bring them out with wonders.

## Exodus 4: Signs and Aaron Appointed

Moses doubts that the people will believe him, so the Lord gives him signs: his rod becomes a serpent and returns to a rod, his hand becomes leprous and is healed, and water from the river becomes blood. Moses says he is slow of speech, but the Lord declares He makes man's mouth and appoints Aaron, Moses' brother, to speak for him. Moses returns to Jethro, seeks permission to go back to Egypt, and sets out with his wife and sons. On the journey, the Lord meets him and seeks to kill him, but Zipporah circumcises her son and the danger passes. Aaron meets Moses at the mount of God, and together they gather the elders of Israel, perform the signs, and the people believe and bow their heads in worship.

## Exodus 5: Pharaoh Refuses and Increases Burden

Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh and declare that the Lord God of Israel says to let His people go to hold a feast in the wilderness. Pharaoh refuses, saying he does not know the Lord and will not let Israel go. He increases their burden by requiring the same number of bricks without providing straw, forcing the people to gather stubble themselves. The officers of Israel are beaten when the quota is not met, and they complain to Pharaoh, who accuses them of idleness. The people blame Moses and Aaron for worsening their situation, and Moses questions the Lord about why He has allowed this trouble and not yet delivered His people.

## Exodus 6: God Reaffirms His Covenant

The Lord tells Moses that now Pharaoh will see His strong hand and drive Israel out. God reveals Himself again as the Lord and recalls His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising to redeem Israel with a stretched-out arm and bring them into the promised land. Moses delivers this message, but the people do not listen because of anguish and cruel bondage. The Lord commands Moses and Aaron to speak again to Pharaoh. A genealogy lists the families of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, focusing on Levi's descendants, including Amram, Aaron, Moses, and their families. God confirms that Moses and Aaron are to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt.

## Exodus 7: Rod Becomes Serpent and Water to Blood

The Lord tells Moses that Aaron will be his prophet and that Pharaoh's heart will be hardened so that God's wonders may be multiplied in Egypt. Moses is eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they speak to Pharaoh. Aaron casts down his rod before Pharaoh, and it becomes a serpent, and the magicians of Egypt do the same, but Aaron's rod swallows theirs. Pharaoh's heart remains hardened. The Lord instructs Moses to meet Pharaoh by the river, where Aaron strikes the waters, and they turn to blood; fish die, the river stinks, and the Egyptians cannot drink. The magicians imitate the sign, and Pharaoh's heart stays hard.

## Exodus 8: Frogs, Lice, and Flies

Aaron stretches out his rod over the waters, and frogs cover the land of Egypt, entering houses and beds. Pharaoh asks Moses to entreat the Lord to remove the frogs and promises to let the people go, but when relief comes, he hardens his heart again. Aaron strikes the dust, and it becomes lice on man and beast, and the magicians cannot replicate it, admitting, "This is the finger of God," yet Pharaoh does not listen. Swarms of flies fill Egypt except the land of Goshen, where Israel dwells. Pharaoh offers compromise, but when the flies are removed at Moses' request, he again hardens his heart and refuses to let the people go.

## Exodus 9: Murrain, Boils, and Hail

The Lord sends a grievous murrain on Egyptian cattle, but none of Israel's livestock dies. Pharaoh verifies the distinction yet hardens his heart. Moses and Aaron scatter ashes toward heaven, and boils break out on man and beast, even on the magicians. The Lord then sends hail mixed with fire that destroys crops, livestock, and servants in the field, except in Goshen. Pharaoh admits he has sinned and asks for the hail to cease, but when it stops, he and his servants harden their hearts again.

## Exodus 10: Locusts and Darkness

The Lord announces further signs so that His power will be known. Moses warns of locusts, and when Pharaoh refuses, locusts cover the land and devour what hail has left. Pharaoh confesses sin and asks for forgiveness, but after a strong west wind removes the locusts, he hardens his heart. A thick darkness covers Egypt for three days, while the children of Israel have light in their dwellings. Pharaoh offers another compromise, but when Moses insists all must go, Pharaoh drives him away and warns him not to see his face again.

## Exodus 11: Announcement of the Death of the Firstborn

The Lord tells Moses that one more plague will come, after which Pharaoh will let Israel go completely. He instructs the people to borrow jewels of silver and gold from the Egyptians. Moses announces that about midnight all the firstborn in Egypt will die, from Pharaoh's son to the servant's child and the firstborn of beasts, but no harm will touch Israel. A great cry will arise in Egypt, and then Pharaoh will thrust them out. Moses leaves Pharaoh in great anger.

## Exodus 12: The Passover and Exodus

The Lord institutes the Passover, setting the first month as the beginning of months and commanding each household to take a lamb without blemish, kill it at evening, and apply its blood to the doorposts. They are to eat the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs in haste, dressed for departure. The Lord strikes all the firstborn in Egypt at midnight, and there is a great cry, but He passes over the houses marked by blood. Pharaoh calls for Moses and Aaron by night and urges them to depart with all the people and their flocks. The Israelites leave in haste, carrying unleavened dough and spoiling the Egyptians, about six hundred thousand men besides children. God gives ordinances concerning the Passover and the redemption of the firstborn.

## Exodus 13: Firstborn and Feast of Unleavened Bread

The Lord commands that every firstborn male be sanctified to Him and institutes the Feast of Unleavened Bread as a memorial of deliverance. Moses leads the people not through the way of the Philistines but toward the Red Sea, and they go armed out of Egypt. Moses takes the bones of Joseph with him, fulfilling Joseph's request. The Lord goes before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night to guide them. The pillar does not depart from before the people.

## Exodus 14: The Red Sea

Pharaoh regrets letting Israel go and pursues them with chariots and horsemen. The Israelites see the Egyptians approaching and fear greatly, accusing Moses of bringing them to die in the wilderness. Moses tells them to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. The angel of God and the pillar of cloud move behind Israel, separating them from the Egyptians. Moses stretches out his hand over the sea, and the waters divide, allowing Israel to pass through on dry ground. The Egyptians follow, but the waters return at Moses' command, drowning Pharaoh's army, and Israel sees the Egyptians dead on the shore.

## Exodus 15: Song of Moses and Miriam

Moses and the children of Israel sing a song praising the Lord for overthrowing the horse and rider in the sea and declaring His power and holiness. Miriam, the prophetess and sister of Aaron, leads the women with timbrels and dancing. The people travel three days into the wilderness and find bitter waters at Marah, and they murmur against Moses. The Lord shows Moses a tree that makes the waters sweet and gives statutes and promises healing if they obey His voice. They come to Elim, where there are twelve wells and seventy palm trees, and they encamp there.

## Exodus 16: Manna and Quail

In the wilderness of Sin, the whole congregation murmurs for lack of food and longs for Egypt. The Lord promises bread from heaven and sends quail in the evening and manna in the morning. The people are to gather a daily portion, with a double portion on the sixth day for the Sabbath. Some attempt to store manna and it breeds worms, and others gather on the Sabbath and find none. Moses instructs that an omer of manna be kept before the Lord for future generations. The children of Israel eat manna forty years until they come to the border of Canaan.

## Exodus 17: Water from the Rock and Amalek

The people camp at Rephidim and find no water, so they chide with Moses. The Lord tells Moses to strike the rock at Horeb with his rod, and water comes out for the people to drink. The place is called Massah and Meribah because of their tempting and striving. Amalek fights with Israel, and Moses stands on the hill with the rod of God while Joshua leads the battle. When Moses' hands are raised, Israel prevails; when lowered, Amalek prevails, so Aaron and Hur support his hands until sunset. Joshua defeats Amalek, and the Lord declares He will blot out Amalek's remembrance.

## Exodus 18: Jethro's Visit and Advice

Jethro, priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, hears of Israel's deliverance and brings Zipporah and Moses' sons to him. Moses recounts all the Lord has done, and Jethro rejoices and blesses the Lord. Seeing Moses judge the people alone from morning to evening, Jethro advises him to appoint capable men as rulers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens to handle smaller matters. Moses accepts the counsel and establishes the system, bringing only hard cases to himself. Jethro departs to his own land.

## Exodus 19: Israel at Sinai

In the third month after leaving Egypt, Israel arrives at Mount Sinai and camps before the mountain. The Lord calls to Moses from the mount and declares that Israel will be a peculiar treasure and a kingdom of priests if they obey His voice and keep His covenant. The people agree to do all the Lord has spoken. The Lord commands that the people be sanctified and set bounds around the mountain, warning that anyone who touches it will die. On the third day there are thunders, lightnings, a thick cloud, and the sound of a trumpet as the Lord descends upon Sinai in fire, and Moses goes up to meet God.

## Exodus 20: The Ten Commandments

God speaks the Ten Commandments, commanding no other gods, no graven images, not taking His name in vain, keeping the Sabbath holy, honoring father and mother, and forbidding murder, adultery, theft, false witness, and coveting. The people fear the thunder, lightning, trumpet, and smoke and stand afar off. Moses tells them God has come to prove them and that they should not fear. The Lord commands that they make no gods of silver or gold and instructs them to build an altar of earth or unhewn stone without steps, so that their nakedness is not exposed.

## Exodus 21: Laws of Servants and Personal Injury

The Lord gives laws concerning Hebrew servants, including terms of service and release in the seventh year. He provides statutes regarding personal injury, such as penalties for assault, manslaughter, and harm caused by animals. Laws address responsibility for damages, including injury to servants and consequences for a goring ox. The judgments set distinctions between accidental harm and deliberate wrongdoing. These ordinances regulate justice among the people.

## Exodus 22: Laws of Theft and Moral Conduct

The Lord gives laws about theft, restitution, and responsibility for lost or damaged property. He commands just treatment of strangers, widows, and the fatherless, warning that their cry will bring His wrath. Regulations address moral conduct, sorcery, bestiality, and idolatry. Instructions include offering firstfruits and not reviling rulers. The people are called to be holy men and not eat torn flesh.

## Exodus 23: Justice, Feasts, and the Angel

The Lord commands that false reports and unjust judgments be avoided and that the poor and strangers be treated fairly. He instructs observance of the Sabbath and three annual feasts: Unleavened Bread, Harvest, and Ingathering. The Lord promises to send an angel before Israel to drive out the inhabitants of the land and warns them not to serve other gods. He promises gradual conquest so the land is not desolate. Moses writes the words of the Lord, builds an altar, and the people affirm the covenant, and Moses sprinkles the blood of the covenant on the people.

## Exodus 24: The Covenant Confirmed

Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders go up and worship from afar, while Moses alone approaches the Lord. The elders see the God of Israel and eat and drink in His presence. The Lord calls Moses up into the mount and gives him tables of stone with the law and commandments. Moses enters the cloud, and the glory of the Lord rests on Mount Sinai like devouring fire. He remains on the mount forty days and forty nights.

## Exodus 25: Offerings and the Ark

The Lord commands offerings for the sanctuary from willing hearts and gives instructions for building the tabernacle. He describes the ark of the covenant with its mercy seat and cherubim of gold. He details the table for showbread and the golden candlestick with its branches and lamps. All are to be made according to the pattern shown on the mount. The sanctuary is to be a dwelling place among them.

## Exodus 26: The Tabernacle Structure

Instructions are given for the curtains of fine linen with cherubim, joined together to form the tabernacle covering. The Lord specifies boards of shittim wood, sockets of silver, and bars to hold the structure upright. A veil is to divide the holy place from the most holy, where the ark will be placed. Another hanging is to serve as the door of the tent. The design establishes inner and outer sections.

## Exodus 27: The Altar and Court

The Lord commands construction of the altar of burnt offering with horns on its corners and a grate of brass. He instructs the making of the court with linen hangings, pillars, and sockets. The oil for the lamp is to be pure olive oil, causing the lamp to burn continually. Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamp from evening to morning. These elements complete the outer arrangements.

## Exodus 28: The Priestly Garments

The Lord appoints Aaron and his sons to serve as priests and describes their holy garments. The ephod, breastplate with twelve stones, robe, coat, mitre, and girdle are to be made with specific materials and engravings. The breastplate bears the names of the tribes, and the Urim and Thummim are placed within it. A golden plate engraved "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" is fixed on the mitre. The garments are for glory and beauty and for ministering in the priest's office.

## Exodus 29: Consecration of the Priests

The Lord outlines the consecration of Aaron and his sons with washing, garments, anointing, and sacrifices of bullocks and rams. Blood is placed on their ear, thumb, and toe as part of the ritual. Daily burnt offerings are to be made continually at the door of the tabernacle. The Lord promises to dwell among the children of Israel and be their God. The altar is sanctified for continual use.

## Exodus 30: Altar of Incense, Ransom, and Laver

Instructions are given for the altar of incense, to be placed before the veil and used daily. A ransom offering is required when numbering the people. The laver of brass is to be set between the tabernacle and the altar for washing. The holy anointing oil and pure incense are prescribed with strict formulas, and they are not to be duplicated for common use. These provisions maintain holiness in worship.

## Exodus 31: Bezaleel, Aholiab, and the Sabbath

The Lord names Bezaleel of the tribe of Judah and Aholiab of the tribe of Dan as craftsmen filled with the spirit of God to make all the tabernacle furnishings. He reiterates the importance of keeping the Sabbath as a sign between Him and Israel, warning that those who profane it shall be put to death. The Sabbath is declared a perpetual covenant. God gives Moses two tables of testimony written with the finger of God. These conclude the instructions on the mount.

## Exodus 32: The Golden Calf

While Moses delays on the mount, the people gather to Aaron and ask for gods to go before them. Aaron collects gold earrings and fashions a molten calf, and the people proclaim a feast. The Lord tells Moses the people have corrupted themselves and threatens to consume them, but Moses pleads for them, appealing to God's promises. Moses descends, sees the calf and dancing, breaks the tables, burns the calf, grinds it to powder, and makes the people drink it. The sons of Levi slay about three thousand men at Moses' command, and a plague follows because of the calf.

## Exodus 33: The Tabernacle Outside the Camp

The Lord tells Moses to lead the people toward the promised land but says He will not go in their midst lest He consume them. The people mourn and remove their ornaments. Moses pitches the tabernacle outside the camp, and the Lord speaks with him face to face as a man speaks to his friend. Moses intercedes, asking that God's presence go with them, and the Lord agrees. Moses asks to see God's glory, and the Lord says He will pass by and proclaim His name but that no man can see His face and live.

## Exodus 34: New Tables and Renewed Covenant

The Lord commands Moses to hew two new tables of stone like the first. The Lord descends in the cloud, proclaims His name and attributes, and renews the covenant, warning against making covenants with the inhabitants of the land. He restates commands about feasts, firstborn, Sabbath, and offerings. Moses remains forty days and nights without eating bread or drinking water while writing the words of the covenant. When he descends, his face shines from speaking with the Lord, and he places a veil over his face when speaking to the people.

## Exodus 35: Sabbath and Freewill Offerings

Moses gathers the congregation and reiterates the command to keep the Sabbath. He invites freewill offerings for the tabernacle, listing materials and items needed. The people bring gold, silver, brass, fabrics, skins, wood, oil, spices, and stones. Bezaleel and Aholiab are appointed to oversee the work. Skilled men and women contribute their abilities.

## Exodus 36: Building the Tabernacle

The craftsmen receive the offerings and begin the work, but the people bring more than enough, so Moses restrains them from bringing further gifts. The tabernacle curtains, coverings, boards, bars, and veil are made according to the pattern given. The structure is assembled piece by piece. The work follows the earlier instructions closely. The sanctuary takes shape.

## Exodus 37: The Ark, Table, and Candlestick

Bezaleel makes the ark of shittim wood with the mercy seat and cherubim of gold. He constructs the table of showbread with its vessels and the golden candlestick with its lamps. The altar of incense and the holy anointing oil and pure incense are also prepared. Each item matches the earlier specifications. The furnishings are completed.

## Exodus 38: The Altar, Laver, and Court

The altar of burnt offering and its grate are made, along with all its vessels. The laver of brass is formed from the looking glasses of the women. The court with its pillars, hangings, and gate is constructed. An accounting lists the gold, silver, and brass used in the work. The materials are dedicated for the sanctuary.

## Exodus 39: The Priests' Garments Completed

The priests' garments are made, including the ephod, breastplate with its twelve stones, robe, coats, mitres, and girdles. The golden plate engraved "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" is completed. The children of Israel do all the work as the Lord commanded Moses. The finished tabernacle and its furnishings are brought to Moses. Moses inspects the work and blesses them.

## Exodus 40: The Tabernacle Erected

The Lord commands Moses to set up the tabernacle on the first day of the first month. Moses erects the tabernacle, places the ark, table, candlestick, altars, laver, and hangings, and anoints and sanctifies all. Aaron and his sons are washed and clothed and begin their priestly service. A cloud covers the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord fills the tabernacle so that Moses cannot enter. The cloud remains by day and fire by night in the sight of all Israel throughout their journeys.
