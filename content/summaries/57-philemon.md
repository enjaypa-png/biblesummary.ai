# Philemon

This personal letter from Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy is addressed to Philemon, a beloved friend and fellow laborer, as well as to Apphia, Archippus, and the church that meets in Philemon's house. Paul begins with a prayer of thanksgiving for Philemon's love and faith toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints. He expresses his joy and consolation in Philemon's love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by him.

The central purpose of the letter is Paul's appeal on behalf of Onesimus, Philemon's runaway slave, whom Paul has converted to Christianity while in prison. Paul refers to Onesimus as his son, whom he has begotten in his bonds. He acknowledges that Onesimus was formerly unprofitable to Philemon but is now profitable to both of them. Paul is sending Onesimus back to Philemon and asks him to receive him as he would receive Paul himself, that is, as his own heart. Paul expresses his desire to keep Onesimus with him, so that he might minister to him in his imprisonment for the gospel, but he does not want to do so without Philemon's consent, so that Philemon's good deed might be voluntary and not by compulsion.

Paul suggests that perhaps Onesimus departed for a while for this very reason, that Philemon might receive him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave—a beloved brother, especially to Paul, but even more so to Philemon, both in the flesh and in the Lord. Paul urges Philemon to receive Onesimus as he would receive Paul himself. If Onesimus has wronged Philemon or owes him anything, Paul offers to pay it himself, writing with his own hand that he will repay it. He gently reminds Philemon that he owes Paul his very self.

Paul expresses his confidence in Philemon's obedience, knowing that he will do even more than he asks. He also asks Philemon to prepare a guest room for him, as he hopes to be granted to them through their prayers. The letter concludes with greetings from Epaphras, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, Paul's fellow laborers, and a final blessing of grace.
