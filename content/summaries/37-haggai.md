## Haggai 1: Command to Build the LORD's House

In the second year of Darius the king, the word of the LORD comes through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest. The LORD says that the people claim the time has not come to build His house, yet they live in finished houses while His house lies waste. He tells them to consider their ways. They sow much but harvest little, eat but are not satisfied, drink but are not filled, clothe themselves but are not warm, and earn wages that disappear quickly. The LORD commands them to go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house so that He may take pleasure in it. He explains that because His house remains in ruins, He withholds dew and calls for drought on the land, crops, livestock, and all their labor.

Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant of the people obey the voice of the LORD and fear Him. The LORD speaks again through Haggai, saying, "I am with you." He stirs the spirit of Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant, and they come and work on the house of the LORD of hosts their God on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.

## Haggai 2: The Latter Glory and Zerubbabel Chosen

On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD comes again through Haggai to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant. He asks who remembers the former glory of the house and how it appears now. He tells Zerubbabel, Joshua, and all the people to be strong and work, for He is with them. He says His Spirit remains among them. The LORD declares that He will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land, and the desire of all nations will come. He says the silver and gold belong to Him and that the glory of this latter house will be greater than the former, and in this place He will give peace.

On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the LORD speaks again. He asks the priests about holiness and uncleanness, and they answer that uncleanness spreads but holiness does not transfer. He says the people and their work have been unclean, and He has struck their crops with blight and hail. He calls them to consider from this day forward, from the day the foundation of the LORD's temple is laid, and promises that from this day He will bless them. The word of the LORD comes again to Haggai for Zerubbabel, saying He will shake the heavens and earth, overthrow kingdoms, and destroy strength. He says He will take Zerubbabel and make him like a signet, for He has chosen him.
