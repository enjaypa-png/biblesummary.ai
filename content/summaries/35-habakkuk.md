## Habakkuk 1: Habakkuk's Complaint and the LORD's Answer

The burden that Habakkuk the prophet sees begins with his complaint to the LORD. Habakkuk asks how long he must cry out about violence without being heard. He says destruction and strife surround him, the law is ignored, and justice never moves forward. The wicked surround the righteous, and judgment comes out twisted.

The LORD answers that He is raising up the Chaldeans, a bitter and swift nation. They march through the earth and take homes that are not theirs. They are feared and dreaded, and their own strength becomes their law. Their horses move faster than leopards, and their horsemen spread out to gather captives like sand. They mock kings and rulers and laugh at fortified cities, building up dirt and taking them. Then they move on like the wind and hold themselves guilty, because their own power is their god.

Habakkuk responds again and calls the LORD everlasting and holy. He says the LORD appoints the Chaldeans for judgment and correction. Yet he struggles with how the One whose eyes are too pure to look on evil can remain silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves. He says people are treated like fish without a ruler, taken up with hooks and nets. The enemy rejoices in his catch and offers sacrifice to his net, because it brings him wealth. Habakkuk asks if the enemy will keep emptying his net and destroying nations without mercy.

## Habakkuk 2: The Vision and Woes to the Wicked

Habakkuk stands on his watch and waits to see how the LORD will answer. The LORD tells him to write the vision clearly so a reader can run with it. The vision is set for an appointed time and will speak at the end. If it seems slow, he must wait for it, because it will surely come. The LORD contrasts the proud man, whose soul is not upright, with the just man who lives by faith.

A series of woes follows against the one who gathers what is not his and loads himself with pledges. Creditors will rise up and make him a spoil. Because he plunders many nations, the remaining people will plunder him in return for bloodshed and violence. Woe comes to the one who covets evil gain to set his nest on high and secure himself from harm. He brings shame to his house and sins against his own soul. The stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam will answer it.

Another woe is spoken against the one who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by wrongdoing. The people labor only to feed the fire, because the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. Woe also comes to the one who gives his neighbor drink to look on his nakedness. He will drink shame instead of glory, and violence done to Lebanon and the beasts will cover him. Idols are exposed as lifeless images that cannot speak. The chapter ends with the LORD in His holy temple, and all the earth is commanded to keep silence before Him.

## Habakkuk 3: Habakkuk's Prayer of Faith

Habakkuk prays and calls it a prayer set to music. He asks the LORD to revive His work in the midst of the years and to remember mercy in wrath. He describes God coming from Teman and the Holy One from mount Paran. His glory covers the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise. Brightness shines like light from His hand, and power is hidden there. Before Him goes pestilence, and burning coals follow at His feet.

He stands and measures the earth, driving nations apart. The everlasting mountains scatter, and the hills bow. Habakkuk sees tents in affliction and curtains trembling. He asks if the LORD is angry with the rivers and the sea when He rides on horses and chariots of salvation. The bow is made bare, and the earth splits with rivers. The sun and moon stand still at the light of His arrows. He marches through the land in indignation and threshes the nations in anger. He goes forth for the salvation of His people and strikes the head of the wicked house.

Habakkuk says his body trembles and his lips quiver at what he hears. Yet he resolves to wait quietly for the day of trouble that comes upon the invading people. Even if the fig tree does not blossom and there is no fruit on the vine, even if the fields yield no food and the flocks are cut off, he says he will rejoice in the LORD. He declares that the Lord GOD is his strength, who makes his feet like a deer's and sets him on high places. The prayer closes with a note to the chief singer on stringed instruments.
