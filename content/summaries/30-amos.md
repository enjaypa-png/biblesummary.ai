# Amos

## Amos 1: Judgment on Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, and Ammon

Amos, a herdman of Tekoa, speaks during the days of Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. He declares that the Lord roars from Zion and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the habitations of the shepherds mourn. Judgment is announced on Damascus for repeated transgressions because they thresh Gilead with instruments of iron. Fire comes upon the house of Hazael, the bar of Damascus breaks, the people are cut off, and Syria goes into captivity unto Kir.

The Lord also declares judgment on Gaza for carrying away whole communities to deliver them to Edom. Fire devours the palaces of Gaza, and rulers are cut off from Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron. Tyrus faces fire for delivering up entire communities to Edom and not remembering the brotherly covenant. Edom is judged for pursuing his brother with the sword and keeping his wrath forever. Ammon is judged for ripping up women with child in Gilead to enlarge his border, and fire devours Rabbah while their king and princes go into captivity.

## Amos 2: Judgment on Moab, Judah, and Israel

The Lord declares judgment on Moab for burning the bones of the king of Edom into lime, and fire consumes Kirioth while Moab dies with tumult and the sound of the trumpet. Judah is judged for rejecting the law of the Lord and allowing lies to lead them astray, and fire comes upon Jerusalem. The Lord then speaks against Israel for selling the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes. They trample the heads of the poor into the dust and turn aside the way of the meek.

A man and his father go in to the same maid, and they lay themselves down upon clothes taken in pledge beside every altar. They drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god. The Lord reminds them that he destroys the Amorite before them and brings them up from Egypt, raising up prophets and Nazarites among them. They command the prophets not to prophesy and give the Nazarites wine to drink. The Lord warns that he presses them down as a cart full of sheaves, and their strength and courage fail so that even the mighty cannot deliver themselves.

## Amos 3: Israel Alone Known—Therefore Punished

The Lord speaks against the whole family he brings up from Egypt and says they alone he knows among all families of the earth, so he punishes them for their iniquities. Amos declares that events do not happen without cause: two do not walk together unless agreed, a lion does not roar without prey, and a trumpet does not sound without alarm. The Lord reveals his secret to his servants the prophets before he acts. When the Lord speaks, who can but prophesy?

He calls for witnesses in the palaces of Ashdod and Egypt to see the oppression and violence in Samaria. An adversary surrounds the land and brings down its strength. From Samaria only small remnants remain, like parts of a sheep taken from a lion's mouth. The horns of the altar at Bethel are cut off and fall to the ground. Winter and summer houses are struck, houses of ivory perish, and great houses come to an end.

## Amos 4: Kine of Bashan and Prepare to Meet Your God

The women of Samaria are called kine of Bashan because they oppress the poor and crush the needy while saying to their masters, "Bring, and let us drink." The Lord swears that days come when they are taken away with hooks and carried out at the breaches. Israel comes to Bethel and Gilgal to multiply transgression, bringing sacrifices and tithes while proclaiming free offerings. They love to do this, says the Lord God.

The Lord gives them cleanness of teeth in all their cities and lack of bread, yet they do not return to him. He withholds rain, sends blasting and mildew, locusts, pestilence after the manner of Egypt, and overthrows some of them like Sodom and Gomorrah, yet they do not return. He tells them to prepare to meet their God. He forms the mountains, creates the wind, declares his thought to man, makes the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth.

## Amos 5: Seek the Lord and Live

A lament rises over the house of Israel as a virgin fallen with no one to raise her up. The city that goes out by a thousand leaves a hundred, and the one that goes out by a hundred leaves ten. The Lord calls them to seek him and live, not to seek Bethel, Gilgal, or Beersheba. He is the one who makes the seven stars and Orion and turns deep darkness into morning.

They hate the one who rebukes in the gate and afflict the just, taking bribes and turning aside the poor. The Lord says he knows their many transgressions and mighty sins. He calls them to seek good and not evil and to establish judgment in the gate. He declares that the day of the Lord is darkness and not light. Their feasts and songs are rejected, and he commands that judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream.

## Amos 6: Woe to Those at Ease in Zion

Woe comes to those at ease in Zion and who trust in the mountain of Samaria. They put far away the evil day and lie upon beds of ivory, stretch themselves on couches, eat lambs from the flock and calves from the stall, sing to instruments, drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with chief ointments. They are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

The Lord swears by himself that he abhors the pride of Jacob and hates his palaces, so the city is delivered up. Even if ten men remain in one house, they die. The land is turned into bitterness because they turn judgment into gall and rejoice in a thing of nothing. The Lord raises up a nation against them, and they are afflicted from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.

## Amos 7: Visions of Locusts, Fire, and the Plumbline

Amos sees the Lord forming locusts in the beginning of the latter growth after the king's mowings. The locusts devour the grass of the land, and Amos says, "O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise?" The Lord repents and says it shall not be. Amos then sees the Lord calling to contend by fire, and the fire devours the great deep and part of the land. Amos again pleads, and the Lord repents, saying this also shall not be.

The Lord stands upon a wall with a plumbline and says he sets a plumbline in the midst of his people Israel and will not pass by them anymore. The high places of Isaac are desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel are laid waste. Amaziah the priest of Bethel sends word to Jeroboam king of Israel that Amos conspires against him. Amaziah tells Amos to flee to Judah and prophesy there. Amos answers that he is a herdman and a gatherer of sycomore fruit, and the Lord takes him to prophesy against Israel. He declares that Amaziah's wife is a harlot in the city, his children fall by the sword, and Israel goes into captivity.

## Amos 8: The Basket of Summer Fruit

Amos sees a basket of summer fruit. The Lord says the end comes upon his people Israel and he will not pass by them anymore. The songs of the temple turn into howlings, and many bodies are cast out in silence. The people swallow up the needy and make the ephah small and the shekel great, buying the poor for silver and selling the refuse of the wheat.

The Lord swears that he will not forget their works and that the land trembles and rises like a flood. The sun goes down at noon, and the earth is darkened in the clear day. Feasts turn into mourning and songs into lamentation. A famine comes, not of bread or water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. People wander from sea to sea seeking the word of the Lord and do not find it.

## Amos 9: The Lord Upon the Altar and Restoration of David's Tabernacle

Amos sees the Lord standing upon the altar, commanding that the doorposts be struck so the building falls upon the heads of the people. None escape, though they dig into hell, climb to heaven, hide on Carmel, or go to the bottom of the sea. The Lord sets his eyes upon them for evil and not for good. He touches the land and it melts, and he builds his stories in the heaven and calls for the waters of the sea.

The Lord says Israel is like the Ethiopians to him, and he brings up Israel from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir. He declares that the sinful kingdom is destroyed from off the face of the earth, yet he does not utterly destroy the house of Jacob. He sifts Israel among the nations like grain in a sieve, yet not the least grain falls to the earth. Sinners who say evil will not overtake them die by the sword. In that day he raises up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, builds it as in the days of old, brings again the captivity of his people Israel, and plants them upon their land so they are no more pulled up.
