# Mark

## Mark 1: John the Baptist and the Beginning of Jesus's Ministry

John the Baptist appears in the wilderness and preaches a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. People from Judaea and Jerusalem come to him, confess their sins, and are baptized in the river Jordan. John wears camel's hair and a leather belt and eats locusts and wild honey. He announces that someone stronger than he is coming after him and says he is not worthy to stoop down and untie his sandals. He baptizes with water, but the one coming will baptize with the Holy Ghost.

Jesus comes from Nazareth of Galilee and is baptized by John in the Jordan. As Jesus comes up out of the water, he sees the heavens opened and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A voice from heaven says, "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The Spirit drives Jesus into the wilderness, where he is tempted by Satan for forty days. He is with wild beasts, and angels minister to him.

After John is put in prison, Jesus goes into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, saying that the time is fulfilled and calling people to repent and believe the gospel. He calls Simon and Andrew, then James and John, and they leave their work to follow him. In Capernaum he teaches in the synagogue with authority and casts out an unclean spirit. He heals Simon's wife's mother of a fever and heals many who are sick or possessed. He prays in a solitary place and travels through Galilee preaching and casting out devils. A leper comes to him asking to be made clean, and Jesus touches him and says, "I will; be thou clean," and the leprosy leaves him. Jesus tells him to show himself to the priest, but the man spreads the news, and Jesus stays outside in desert places.

## Mark 2: The Paralytic, Levi, and Sabbath Controversy

Jesus returns to Capernaum, and many gather in a house. Four men bring a paralyzed man, but because of the crowd they uncover the roof and lower him down. Jesus tells him his sins are forgiven. Some scribes think in their hearts that Jesus blasphemes. Jesus knows their thoughts and asks whether it is easier to say that sins are forgiven or to tell the man to rise and walk. He tells the man to take up his bed and go home, and the man rises immediately. The people glorify God.

Jesus calls Levi the son of Alphaeus from the tax collector's booth, and Levi follows him. Jesus eats with tax collectors and sinners, and scribes and Pharisees ask why he eats with them. Jesus says that those who are sick need a physician and that he comes to call sinners to repentance. When asked why his disciples do not fast like others, he speaks of the bridegroom and of new cloth and new wine. On the sabbath his disciples pluck heads of grain, and the Pharisees question him. Jesus refers to David eating the consecrated bread in the temple and says the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath, and that the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

## Mark 3: The Withered Hand, the Twelve Apostles, and a House Divided

In the synagogue Jesus sees a man with a withered hand. The Pharisees watch to see if he heals on the sabbath. Jesus asks whether it is lawful to do good or evil on the sabbath, to save life or to kill. When they remain silent, he heals the man, and the Pharisees plot with the Herodians to destroy him. A great multitude follows him from many regions, and he heals many and casts out unclean spirits who cry out that he is the Son of God, but he commands them not to make him known.

Jesus goes up into a mountain and appoints twelve to be with him and to preach and to have power to heal sicknesses and cast out devils. He names them: Simon, whom he surnames Peter; James the son of Zebedee; John the brother of James; Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrays him. Scribes from Jerusalem say he casts out devils by Beelzebub. Jesus answers with parables about a divided kingdom and warns about blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. His mother and his brothers seek him, and he says that whoever does the will of God is his brother, sister, and mother.

## Mark 4: Parables and the Calming of the Storm

Jesus teaches by the sea and speaks in parables. He tells of a sower who scatters seed on different kinds of ground, and only the good ground brings forth fruit. He explains the parable to his disciples, saying the seed is the word and describing the different responses people have to it. He speaks of a candle not being hidden, of the measure used being measured back, and of seed growing secretly until harvest. He compares the kingdom of God to a grain of mustard seed that grows into a great plant. He speaks many such parables and explains them privately to his disciples.

In the evening Jesus tells his disciples to cross to the other side of the sea. A great storm arises, and waves beat into the ship. Jesus sleeps on a pillow. They wake him, and he rebukes the wind and says to the sea, "Peace, be still." The wind ceases, and there is a great calm. He asks why they are fearful and have no faith. They fear greatly and ask what manner of man this is, that even the wind and the sea obey him.

## Mark 5: The Gadarene Demoniac, Jairus's Daughter, and the Woman with the Issue of Blood

Jesus comes to the country of the Gadarenes, where a man with an unclean spirit meets him from the tombs. The man lives among the tombs, breaks chains, and cries out. He runs and worships Jesus, and Jesus commands the unclean spirit to come out. The spirit says its name is Legion because they are many. They ask to enter a herd of swine nearby. Jesus gives permission, and the unclean spirits enter the swine, which run into the sea and drown. The man sits clothed and in his right mind. The people ask Jesus to depart. The man asks to go with Jesus, but Jesus tells him to go home and tell what the Lord has done for him.

Jesus crosses back over the sea, and Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, asks him to heal his dying daughter. On the way, a woman who has suffered from bleeding for twelve years touches his garment and is healed. Jesus asks who touched him, and she tells him the truth. He says, "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace." News comes that Jairus's daughter is dead, but Jesus tells him not to fear, only believe. He goes to the house with Peter, James, and John, takes the child by the hand, and says, "Talitha cumi," which means, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. The girl rises and walks.

## Mark 6: Rejection at Nazareth, John's Death, and the Feeding of the Five Thousand

Jesus comes into his own country, and many are offended at him, saying he is the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Juda, and Simon. He marvels at their unbelief and does not do many mighty works there. He sends out the twelve two by two, giving them power over unclean spirits and instructing them to take little with them. They preach repentance, cast out devils, and anoint the sick with oil and heal them.

King Herod hears of Jesus and thinks John the Baptist has risen from the dead. The narrative recounts how Herod had imprisoned John because of Herodias. At a feast, Herodias's daughter dances, and Herod promises her whatever she asks. At her mother's urging, she asks for John's head. John is beheaded in prison.

The apostles return to Jesus, and he leads them to a desert place, but a multitude follows. He feeds five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, and twelve baskets of fragments remain. He walks on the sea to his disciples and enters the ship, and the wind ceases. Many bring the sick to him, and as many as touch him are made whole.

## Mark 7: Tradition of the Elders and the Canaanite Woman

Pharisees and scribes question Jesus about his disciples eating with unwashed hands. Jesus rebukes them for setting aside God's commandment to keep their own traditions. He speaks of Corban, a practice of dedicating money to God as a way to avoid helping one's parents. He calls the people and teaches that nothing entering a person from outside defiles them, but what comes out of the heart defiles. He explains privately that evil thoughts and sins proceed from within.

Jesus goes to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. A woman whose young daughter has an unclean spirit asks him for help. He speaks of the children's bread and the dogs, and she answers that even the dogs eat crumbs under the table. He tells her the devil has gone out of her daughter. He heals a deaf man with a speech impediment, putting his fingers into his ears and saying, "Ephphatha," that is, Be opened. The man speaks plainly.

## Mark 8: Feeding the Four Thousand and Peter's Confession

Jesus feeds about four thousand with seven loaves and a few small fishes, and seven baskets of fragments remain. Pharisees seek a sign from heaven, and he refuses, saying no sign will be given to that generation. In the ship he warns his disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod, and they misunderstand. At Bethsaida he heals a blind man gradually, first so that the man sees people as trees walking, then clearly.

At Caesarea Philippi Jesus asks his disciples who people say he is. Peter answers that he is the Christ. Jesus commands them to tell no one and begins to teach that the Son of man must suffer, be rejected, be killed, and rise again. Peter rebukes him, and Jesus rebukes Peter, saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan." He calls the people and says that whoever will follow him must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow him.

## Mark 9: The Transfiguration and the Lunatick Boy

Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up into a high mountain and is transfigured before them. His garments become shining white. Elias and Moses appear and speak with him. A cloud overshadows them, and a voice says, "This is my beloved Son: hear him." Suddenly they see only Jesus. He tells them to tell no one until the Son of man rises from the dead. He speaks with them about Elias.

They come down and see a multitude and scribes questioning the disciples. A man says his son has a spirit that makes him unable to speak and throws him down. The disciples cannot cast it out. Jesus rebukes the spirit, and the boy is restored. He tells his disciples that this kind comes out only by prayer and fasting. He again speaks of his coming betrayal, death, and resurrection, and they do not understand. In Capernaum he teaches about greatness, setting a child among them, and warns about causing little ones to stumble, about cutting off what causes offense, and about hell fire. He speaks of being salted with fire and having peace.

## Mark 10: Marriage, Riches, and Bartimaeus

Jesus teaches about divorce, referring to the creation of male and female and saying what God joins together should not be put asunder. He blesses little children and says whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it. A rich young man asks what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments and then to sell what he has and give to the poor. The man goes away grieved. Jesus speaks about the difficulty for the rich to enter the kingdom and promises that those who leave houses or family for his sake will receive a hundredfold and eternal life.

He foretells his death and resurrection again. James and John ask to sit at his right and left in glory. Jesus speaks of drinking the cup he drinks and of serving rather than ruling. In Jericho, blind Bartimaeus calls out to Jesus as the Son of David. Jesus asks what he wants, and Bartimaeus asks to receive his sight. Jesus tells him his faith has made him whole, and he receives his sight and follows Jesus.

## Mark 11: The Triumphal Entry and the Temple

Jesus approaches Jerusalem and sends two disciples to bring a colt. He rides into the city, and many spread garments and branches and cry, "Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." He looks around the temple and later curses a fig tree that has leaves but no fruit. He enters the temple and drives out those who buy and sell, overturns tables, and says his house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations, but they have made it a den of thieves. The fig tree withers. He teaches about faith and forgiveness.

Chief priests, scribes, and elders question his authority. He asks them about the baptism of John, and they cannot answer. He tells them he will not tell them by what authority he does these things.

## Mark 12: Parables and Entangling Questions

Jesus speaks the parable of the vineyard tenants who kill the servants and the son sent by the owner. The leaders perceive he speaks against them and seek to seize him. Pharisees and Herodians ask about paying tribute to Caesar. Jesus says to render to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's. Sadducees question him about the resurrection and a woman who had seven husbands. He says they err, not knowing the scriptures or the power of God, and speaks of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

A scribe asks which commandment is the greatest. Jesus answers that the first is to love the Lord thy God with all the heart, soul, mind, and strength, and the second is to love thy neighbour as thyself. He asks how Christ can be David's son if David calls him Lord. He warns against the scribes who desire honor. He watches a poor widow cast two small coins into the treasury and says she has given more than all the others.

## Mark 13: The Olivet Discourse

As Jesus leaves the temple, he foretells that not one stone will be left upon another. On the mount of Olives, Peter, James, John, and Andrew ask him privately about these things. He speaks of wars, earthquakes, famines, persecutions, the abomination of desolation, and great tribulation. He warns them to watch, to endure, and not to be deceived. He says heaven and earth shall pass away, but his words shall not pass away. Of that day and hour no one knows. He tells them to take heed and watch, for they do not know when the master of the house comes.

## Mark 14: The Last Supper and Jesus's Arrest

Chief priests and scribes seek to take Jesus by craft and kill him. In Bethany a woman anoints his head with ointment. Some are displeased, but Jesus says she has done a good work and has anointed his body for burial. Judas Iscariot goes to the chief priests to betray him.

On the first day of unleavened bread, Jesus eats the passover with the twelve. He says one of them will betray him. He takes bread and says, "Take, eat: this is my body." He takes the cup and says, "This is my blood of the new testament." They sing a hymn and go to the mount of Olives.

Jesus tells them they will all be offended because of him, and Peter says he will not deny him. In Gethsemane Jesus prays that the hour might pass from him, yet submits to the Father's will. Judas arrives with a multitude, and Jesus is taken. All the disciples flee. Before the council, false witnesses speak against him. The high priest asks if he is the Christ, the Son of the Blessed, and Jesus answers, "I am." They condemn him. Peter denies him three times before the rooster crows, and he weeps.

## Mark 15: The Crucifixion and Burial

In the morning the chief priests deliver Jesus to Pilate. Pilate asks if he is the King of the Jews, and Jesus answers, "Thou sayest it." The crowd chooses Barabbas to be released and calls for Jesus to be crucified. Soldiers mock him, put on him a purple robe and a crown of thorns, and lead him out. Simon of Cyrene carries his cross.

They crucify him at Golgotha and divide his garments. The inscription reads, The King of the Jews. Two thieves are crucified with him. Darkness covers the land, and Jesus cries, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He cries with a loud voice and breathes his last. The veil of the temple is torn in two. A centurion says, "Truly this man was the Son of God." Joseph of Arimathaea asks for the body and lays it in a tomb.

## Mark 16: The Resurrection and the Great Commission

Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome come to the tomb early on the first day of the week. They see the stone rolled away. A young man in a white garment tells them that Jesus is risen and is not there, and instructs them to tell the disciples and Peter that he goes before them into Galilee. They flee trembling and say nothing to anyone, for they are afraid.

Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. She tells the disciples, but they do not believe. He appears to two of them as they walk into the country, and later to the eleven as they are eating together. He rebukes their unbelief and tells them to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He speaks of signs that will follow those who believe. After speaking with them, he is received up into heaven and sits on the right hand of God. The disciples go forth and preach everywhere, and the Lord works with them, confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
