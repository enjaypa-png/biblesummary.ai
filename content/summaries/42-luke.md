# Luke

## Luke 1: The Births of John the Baptist and Jesus Foretold

In the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a priest named Zacharias serves in the temple. He and his wife Elisabeth are both righteous but have no children because Elisabeth is barren, and they are both old. While Zacharias burns incense, the angel Gabriel appears to him and says Elisabeth will bear a son who is to be named John. The child will be great before the Lord, will drink no wine or strong drink, and will be filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb. He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. Zacharias asks how he can know this, since he and his wife are old. Gabriel says Zacharias will be unable to speak until these things come to pass because he did not believe.

The angel Gabriel is also sent to a city of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin named Mary who is engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. Gabriel tells Mary she is highly favored and will conceive and bear a son to be called Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. His kingdom will have no end. Mary asks how this can be, since she has not been with a man. Gabriel tells her the Holy Ghost will come upon her and the power of the Highest will overshadow her. He also tells her that Elisabeth, her cousin, has conceived a son in her old age. Mary visits Elisabeth, and when Elisabeth hears Mary's greeting, the baby leaps in her womb. Elisabeth is filled with the Holy Ghost and calls Mary blessed. Mary speaks words of praise, saying her soul magnifies the Lord. She stays with Elisabeth about three months and then returns home. Elisabeth gives birth to a son, and on the eighth day the family wants to name him Zacharias, but Elisabeth says his name is John. They ask Zacharias, and he writes that his name is John. Immediately his mouth is opened, and he speaks, praising God. He prophesies about the coming salvation and about his son, who will go before the Lord to prepare his ways.

## Luke 2: The Birth of Jesus and His Childhood

Caesar Augustus issues a decree that all the world should be taxed, and everyone goes to their own city to be registered. Joseph goes from Nazareth to Bethlehem, the city of David, because he is of the house and lineage of David. He goes with Mary, who is expecting a child. While they are there, she gives birth to her firstborn son, wraps him in swaddling clothes, and lays him in a manger because there is no room for them in the inn.

In the same region, shepherds are keeping watch over their flock by night. An angel of the Lord appears to them, and the glory of the Lord shines around them. They are greatly afraid. The angel tells them not to fear, for he brings good tidings of great joy for all people — a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, is born in the city of David. They will find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. A multitude of the heavenly host appears, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." The shepherds go to Bethlehem and find Mary, Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. They make known what the angel told them, and all who hear it wonder. Mary keeps all these things in her heart. The shepherds return, glorifying and praising God.

On the eighth day the child is circumcised and named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived. When the days of purification according to the law of Moses are completed, Joseph and Mary bring the child to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. A man in Jerusalem named Simeon, who is just and devout and waiting for the consolation of Israel, takes the child in his arms and blesses God, saying he can now depart in peace because his eyes have seen God's salvation. He tells Mary that a sword will pierce through her own soul. A prophetess named Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, gives thanks and speaks about the child to all who are looking for redemption in Jerusalem. Joseph and Mary return to Nazareth, and the child grows and becomes strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God is upon him. When Jesus is twelve years old, his parents go to Jerusalem for the feast of the passover. On the way home they realize he is not with them and return to find him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening and asking questions. All who hear him are astonished at his understanding. His mother asks why he has done this, and he says he must be about his Father's business. He returns to Nazareth with them and is subject to them. Jesus increases in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.

## Luke 3: John the Baptist and the Baptism of Jesus

In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, the word of God comes to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. He goes into all the country around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight." John speaks to the multitudes that come to be baptized, calling them to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance and not to rely on being children of Abraham. The people ask what they should do, and he tells them to share their coats and food. Tax collectors come to be baptized and ask what they should do, and he tells them to collect no more than what is appointed. Soldiers ask the same, and he tells them not to use violence or make false accusations, and to be content with their wages.

The people wonder whether John might be the Christ, but he says one mightier than he is coming, whose sandal strap he is not worthy to untie. That one will baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire. He will thoroughly purge his floor and gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. John preaches many other things to the people. He also rebukes Herod the tetrarch for Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils Herod has done. Herod responds by shutting John up in prison. When all the people are baptized, Jesus is also baptized. As he prays, heaven opens, and the Holy Ghost descends on him in a bodily shape like a dove. A voice from heaven says, "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased." Jesus begins his ministry at about thirty years of age. His genealogy is traced back through Joseph, through David and Abraham, all the way to Adam, who is called the son of God.

## Luke 4: The Temptation and Rejection at Nazareth

Jesus, full of the Holy Ghost, returns from the Jordan and is led by the Spirit into the wilderness, where he is tempted by the devil for forty days. He eats nothing during that time. The devil tempts him to turn a stone into bread, offers him all the kingdoms of the world in exchange for worship, and takes him to a pinnacle of the temple and tells him to throw himself down. Jesus answers each temptation with scripture. The devil departs from him for a season.

Jesus returns in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and his fame spreads throughout the surrounding region. He teaches in the synagogues and is praised by all. He comes to Nazareth, where he was raised, and goes into the synagogue on the sabbath day. He stands up to read and is handed the book of the prophet Esaias. He reads a passage about the Spirit of the Lord being upon him to preach the gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty those who are bruised. He closes the book and says that this scripture is fulfilled in their ears. All wonder at his gracious words, but they also question him, saying he is Joseph's son. He speaks of how no prophet is accepted in his own country and refers to Elias being sent to a widow in Sidon and Eliseus cleansing Naaman the Syrian. The people in the synagogue are filled with anger and drive him out of the city, leading him to the brow of the hill to throw him down, but he passes through the midst of them and goes his way.

He goes down to Capernaum and teaches on the sabbath days, and the people are astonished at his teaching because his word is with power. A man in the synagogue who has a spirit of an unclean devil cries out, and Jesus rebukes the spirit and it comes out of him. He goes to Simon's house and heals Simon's wife's mother of a high fever. At sunset many bring those who are sick with various diseases, and he lays his hands on every one of them and heals them. Devils also come out of many, crying out that he is Christ, the Son of God, and he rebukes them and does not allow them to speak. In the morning he departs into a desert place. The people seek him and try to keep him from leaving, but he says he must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also, because that is why he was sent.

## Luke 5: The Calling of the First Disciples and Levi

As the people press upon Jesus to hear the word of God, he stands by the lake of Gennesaret and sees two ships at the shore. The fishermen have gone out of them and are washing their nets. He enters Simon's ship and asks him to push out a little from the land. He sits down and teaches the people from the ship. When he finishes, he tells Simon to launch out into the deep and let down the nets. Simon says they have worked all night and caught nothing, but at Jesus's word he will let down the net. They catch such a great number of fish that their net breaks, and they call their partners, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in the other ship to come help. Both ships are so full they begin to sink. Simon Peter falls down at Jesus's knees and says he is a sinful man. Jesus tells him not to fear, for from now on he will catch men. They bring their ships to land, leave everything, and follow him.

In one of the cities a man full of leprosy sees Jesus, falls on his face, and asks to be made clean. Jesus touches him and says he is willing, and immediately the leprosy departs from him. Jesus tells him to tell no one but to go show himself to the priest and offer for his cleansing as Moses commanded. Great multitudes come together to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities, and he withdraws into the wilderness and prays.

On a certain day, as he teaches, Pharisees and doctors of the law are sitting by, having come from every town of Galilee, Judaea, and Jerusalem. Men carry a paralyzed man on a bed and try to bring him in, but because of the crowd they go up on the housetop and let him down through the tiling into the midst before Jesus. When Jesus sees their faith, he says the man's sins are forgiven. The scribes and Pharisees begin to reason, asking who can forgive sins but God alone. Jesus perceives their thoughts and asks whether it is easier to say that sins are forgiven or to say rise up and walk. He tells the paralyzed man to arise, take up his bed, and go to his house, and the man does so immediately, glorifying God. Amazement seizes them all. After this, Jesus goes out and sees a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collection booth. He tells him to follow, and Levi leaves everything and follows him. Levi makes a great feast in his own house, and a large company of tax collectors and others sit down with them. The Pharisees and scribes murmur against the disciples for eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners. Jesus answers that those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick, and that he has not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. They ask why his disciples eat and drink instead of fasting like the disciples of John and of the Pharisees. Jesus answers with a comparison to the bridegroom and about new wine in old bottles.

## Luke 6: The Sermon on the Plain

On the second sabbath after the first, Jesus and his disciples go through the grain fields, and the disciples pluck the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat. Some of the Pharisees ask why they do what is not lawful on the sabbath day. Jesus answers by referring to what David did when he was hungry, entering the house of God and eating the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat. He says that the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

On another sabbath he enters the synagogue and teaches. A man is there whose right hand is withered. The scribes and Pharisees watch him to see if he will heal on the sabbath, so they can accuse him. Jesus knows their thoughts and tells the man to rise up and stand forth. He asks whether it is lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it. He looks around at them all and tells the man to stretch forth his hand. The man does so, and his hand is restored. The scribes and Pharisees are filled with madness and discuss among themselves what they might do to Jesus.

Jesus goes out into a mountain to pray and continues all night in prayer to God. When it is day, he calls his disciples to him and chooses twelve, whom he also names apostles: Simon, whom he also names Peter; Andrew his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon called Zelotes; Judas the brother of James; and Judas Iscariot, who becomes the traitor.

He comes down with them and stands in a plain. A great company of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judaea, Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon come to hear him and to be healed. He heals them all, and power goes out from him. He lifts up his eyes on his disciples and speaks blessings and warnings. He blesses those who are poor, hungry, weeping, and hated for the Son of man's sake. He warns those who are rich, full, laughing, and well spoken of. He teaches his disciples to love their enemies, do good to those who hate them, bless those who curse them, and pray for those who mistreat them. He says to give to everyone who asks and not to demand things back. He says to do to others as they would have others do to them. He says that even sinners love those who love them, so his followers must love their enemies and do good, expecting nothing in return, and they will be children of the Highest. He tells them to be merciful as their Father is merciful, not to judge so they will not be judged, and not to condemn so they will not be condemned. He speaks of a blind man leading a blind man, of a disciple not being above his master, of the beam in one's own eye and the speck in a brother's eye, and of a tree being known by its fruit. He says a good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good, and an evil man out of evil treasure brings forth what is evil. He asks why they call him Lord but do not do what he says. He compares the one who hears his words and does them to a man who builds his house on a rock, and the one who hears and does not do them to a man who builds his house on the earth without a foundation.

## Luke 7: The Centurion's Servant, the Widow's Son, and the Sinful Woman

Jesus enters Capernaum. A centurion has a servant who is sick and near death. The centurion is dear to the people and has built them a synagogue. He sends elders of the Jews to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant. When Jesus is near the house, the centurion sends friends to tell him not to trouble himself, for the centurion does not consider himself worthy to have Jesus come under his roof. He says that he himself is a man set under authority with soldiers under him, and he knows that if Jesus just speaks the word, his servant will be healed. Jesus marvels at this and tells the people following him that he has not found such great faith, not even in Israel. Those who were sent return to the house and find the servant well.

The next day Jesus goes to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd go with him. As he comes near the gate of the city, a dead man is being carried out, the only son of his mother, who is a widow. A large crowd from the city is with her. When the Lord sees her, he has compassion on her and tells her not to weep. He comes and touches the open coffin, and those carrying it stand still. He says, "Young man, I say unto thee, Arise." The dead man sits up and begins to speak, and Jesus delivers him to his mother. Fear comes on all, and they glorify God, saying a great prophet has risen among them and that God has visited his people.

John the Baptist sends two of his disciples to Jesus to ask whether he is the one who should come, or whether they should look for another. At that hour Jesus cures many of infirmities and plagues and evil spirits and gives sight to many who are blind. He tells the messengers to go tell John what they have seen and heard — the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. After the messengers leave, Jesus speaks to the people about John, saying that among those born of women there is no greater prophet than John the Baptist, but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. The Pharisees and lawyers reject the counsel of God against themselves, not having been baptized by John. Jesus compares the people of that generation to children sitting in the marketplace calling to one another. He says John came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and they said he had a devil, and the Son of man came eating and drinking and they call him a glutton and a friend of tax collectors and sinners. He says wisdom is justified by all her children.

A Pharisee asks Jesus to eat with him, and Jesus goes into his house and sits down to eat. A woman in the city who is a sinner learns that Jesus is eating at the Pharisee's house. She brings an alabaster box of ointment, stands at his feet behind him weeping, washes his feet with her tears, wipes them with the hair of her head, kisses his feet, and anoints them with the ointment. The Pharisee, whose name is Simon, thinks to himself that if Jesus were a prophet, he would know that this woman is a sinner. Jesus tells Simon a parable about two debtors — one who owed five hundred pence and another who owed fifty — and both are forgiven when they cannot pay. He asks which will love the creditor more, and Simon answers the one who was forgiven more. Jesus compares Simon's treatment of him with the woman's devotion and tells her that her sins are forgiven. Those sitting at the table question who this is that forgives sins, and Jesus tells the woman that her faith has saved her and to go in peace.

## Luke 8: Parables, the Storm, the Gadarene Demoniac, and Jairus's Daughter

Jesus goes through every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. The twelve are with him, along with certain women who have been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, out of whom seven devils went; Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others who minister to him out of their substance.

A great crowd gathers, and Jesus speaks a parable about a sower who goes out to sow seed. Some falls by the wayside and is trampled and eaten by birds. Some falls on a rock and withers because it lacks moisture. Some falls among thorns and is choked. Some falls on good ground and brings forth fruit a hundredfold. He explains to his disciples that the seed is the word of God and describes what each type of ground represents. He speaks of a candle not being covered or put under a bed, and says nothing is secret that will not be made known. He says to take heed how they hear, for whoever has will be given more, and whoever does not have will lose even what he seems to have. His mother and brothers come to see him but cannot reach him because of the crowd. He is told they are standing outside, and he says that his mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.

One day Jesus gets into a ship with his disciples and tells them to go over to the other side of the lake. As they sail, he falls asleep. A storm of wind comes down on the lake, and the ship fills with water, and they are in danger. They wake him, and he rises and rebukes the wind and the raging of the water. They cease, and there is a calm. He asks where their faith is. They are afraid and amazed, asking one another what kind of man this is, that he commands even the winds and water and they obey him.

They arrive at the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee. A certain man from the city who has devils for a long time meets him. The man wears no clothes and does not live in a house but among the tombs. When he sees Jesus, he cries out, falls down before him, and calls him the Son of God most high. Jesus commands the unclean spirit to come out of the man. The spirit has often seized him, and though he has been kept under guard and bound with chains, he breaks the bonds and is driven by the devil into the wilderness. Jesus asks his name, and he says Legion, because many devils have entered him. They beg Jesus not to command them to go into the deep. A herd of many swine is feeding on the mountain, and the devils beg him to allow them to enter the swine. He permits them, and the devils go out of the man and enter the swine, and the herd runs violently down a steep place into the lake and drowns. Those who fed them see what happens and go tell it in the city and in the country. People come out to see what has happened and find the man sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they are afraid. Those who saw it tell them how the man was healed. The whole multitude from the surrounding country asks Jesus to depart from them, for they are seized with great fear. He gets back into the ship and returns. The man out of whom the devils departed begs to go with him, but Jesus sends him away, telling him to return to his own house and show what great things God has done for him. The man goes and publishes throughout the whole city what Jesus has done for him.

When Jesus returns, the people gladly receive him, for they are all waiting for him. A man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, falls down at Jesus's feet and begs him to come to his house, for his only daughter, about twelve years old, is dying. As Jesus goes, the people throng him. A woman who has had a flow of blood for twelve years and has spent all her living on physicians and cannot be healed by any comes behind him and touches the border of his garment, and immediately the flow of blood stops. Jesus asks who touched him, and when all deny it, Peter and those with him say the multitude is thronging and pressing him. Jesus says someone has touched him, for he perceives that power has gone out of him. The woman, seeing she cannot be hidden, comes trembling, falls down before him, and declares before all the people why she touched him and how she is healed immediately. He tells her to be of good comfort, that her faith has made her whole, and to go in peace.

While he is still speaking, someone comes from the ruler of the synagogue's house and says the girl is dead and there is no need to trouble the master. Jesus hears it and says to Jairus not to fear, only believe, and she will be made whole. He enters the house and allows no one to go in except Peter, James, John, and the father and mother of the maiden. All weep and mourn for her, but he says not to weep, for she is not dead but sleeping. They laugh at him, knowing she is dead. He puts them all out, takes her by the hand, and calls out, saying, "Maid, arise." Her spirit comes again, and she arises immediately. He commands them to give her food. Her parents are astonished, and he charges them to tell no one what is done.

## Luke 9: The Twelve Sent Out, Feeding the Five Thousand, and the Transfiguration

Jesus calls his twelve disciples together and gives them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases. He sends them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He instructs them to take nothing for their journey — no staffs, no bag, no bread, no money, and no extra coats. Whatever house they enter, they are to stay there and depart from there. Wherever people do not receive them, they are to shake the dust off their feet as a testimony against that city. They depart and go through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.

Herod the tetrarch hears of all that is done by Jesus and is perplexed because some say John is risen from the dead, some say Elias has appeared, and others say one of the old prophets has risen again. Herod says he has beheaded John and wonders who this is that he hears such things about. He desires to see Jesus.

The apostles return and tell Jesus all they have done. He takes them and goes privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. The people learn of it and follow him. He receives them, speaks to them about the kingdom of God, and heals those who need healing. When the day begins to end, the twelve come to him and say he should send the multitude away so they can go into the towns and country to find lodging and food, for they are in a desert place. Jesus tells them to give the people something to eat. They say they have no more than five loaves and two fishes, unless they should go and buy food for all these people, for there are about five thousand men. He tells the disciples to make them sit down in groups of fifty. They do so. He takes the five loaves and the two fishes, looks up to heaven, blesses them, breaks them, and gives them to the disciples to set before the multitude. They all eat and are filled, and twelve baskets of fragments remain.

As Jesus is alone praying, his disciples are with him. He asks them who the people say he is. They answer that some say John the Baptist, some say Elias, and others say one of the old prophets has risen again. He asks them who they say he is, and Peter answers that he is the Christ of God. He strictly warns them to tell this to no one. He says the Son of man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised the third day. He tells them all that if anyone will come after him, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow him. Whoever will save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for his sake will save it. He asks what it profits a person to gain the whole world and lose himself. He says whoever is ashamed of him and his words, of that person the Son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his own glory and in his Father's and the holy angels'.

About eight days after these sayings, he takes Peter, John, and James and goes up into a mountain to pray. As he prays, the appearance of his face is altered, and his clothing becomes white and glistening. Two men, Moses and Elias, appear in glory and speak with him about his departure, which he is about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Peter and those with him are heavy with sleep, and when they awake they see his glory and the two men standing with him. As Moses and Elias depart, Peter says it is good for them to be there and offers to make three tabernacles — one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elias — not knowing what he is saying. A cloud overshadows them, and they fear as they enter the cloud. A voice comes out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son: hear him." When the voice is past, Jesus is found alone. They keep it close and tell no one in those days anything they have seen.

The next day, when they come down from the mountain, a great crowd meets him. A man from the crowd cries out that his son is his only child, and a spirit takes him so that he suddenly cries out, and it tears him so that he foams, and after bruising him it hardly departs from him. He has asked the disciples to cast it out, but they cannot. Jesus says, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you?" He tells the man to bring his son. As the boy comes, the devil throws him down and tears him. Jesus rebukes the unclean spirit, heals the child, and delivers him to his father. They are all amazed at the mighty power of God.

While everyone marvels at all the things Jesus does, he tells his disciples to let these sayings sink down into their ears, for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men. They do not understand this saying, and it is hidden from them, and they are afraid to ask him about it. A reasoning arises among them about which of them should be greatest. Jesus, perceiving the thought of their hearts, takes a child and sets him by him. He says whoever receives this child in his name receives him, and whoever receives him receives the one who sent him, for the one who is least among them all will be great. John says they saw someone casting out devils in Jesus's name and forbade him because he does not follow with them. Jesus says not to forbid him, for whoever is not against them is for them.

When the time comes that Jesus should be received up, he steadfastly sets his face to go to Jerusalem. He sends messengers before his face, and they enter a village of the Samaritans to prepare for him. The village does not receive him because his face is set toward Jerusalem. When the disciples James and John see this, they ask if he wants them to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them. Jesus turns and rebukes them. They go to another village. As they travel, a man says he will follow Jesus wherever he goes. Jesus tells him that foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has no place to lay his head. He tells another man to follow him, but the man asks to first go and bury his father. Jesus says to let the dead bury their dead and to go and preach the kingdom of God. Another says he will follow but first wants to say farewell to those at his house. Jesus says no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 10: The Seventy Sent Out, the Good Samaritan, and Mary and Martha

After these things the Lord appoints seventy others and sends them two by two before his face into every city and place where he himself is about to go. He says the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few, and they should pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers. He sends them as lambs among wolves and instructs them to carry no purse, no bag, no shoes, and to greet no one on the way. Whatever house they enter, they are to say peace to it. If a son of peace is there, their peace will rest upon it; if not, it will return to them. They are to remain in that house, eating and drinking what is given, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. They are to heal the sick and say the kingdom of God has come near. He pronounces woe against Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum for not repenting despite the mighty works done in them.

The seventy return with joy, saying that even the devils are subject to them through his name. Jesus tells them he saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven. He says he gives them power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will by any means hurt them. However, they should not rejoice that the spirits are subject to them but rather rejoice that their names are written in heaven. In that hour Jesus rejoices in spirit and thanks the Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and prudent and revealing them to babes. He turns to his disciples privately and says blessed are the eyes that see what they see.

A certain lawyer stands up and tests Jesus, asking what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus asks him what is written in the law and how he reads it. The lawyer answers: love the Lord thy God with all the heart, soul, strength, and mind, and love thy neighbor as thyself. Jesus tells him he has answered rightly, and if he does this he will live. But the lawyer, wanting to justify himself, asks who his neighbor is. Jesus answers with a parable: a certain man goes down from Jerusalem to Jericho and falls among thieves, who strip him, wound him, and depart, leaving him half dead. A priest comes by and passes on the other side. A Levite likewise comes and passes on the other side. But a certain Samaritan comes where he is, has compassion on him, binds up his wounds, pours in oil and wine, sets him on his own beast, brings him to an inn, and takes care of him. The next day he gives the innkeeper two pence and tells him to take care of the man, and whatever more is spent he will repay when he comes again. Jesus asks which of the three was neighbor to the one who fell among the thieves. The lawyer says the one who showed mercy. Jesus tells him to go and do likewise.

As they travel, Jesus enters a certain village. A woman named Martha receives him into her house. Her sister, called Mary, sits at Jesus's feet and hears his word. Martha is distracted with much serving and comes to him, asking if he does not care that her sister has left her to serve alone, and asks him to tell Mary to help her. Jesus answers that Martha is careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.

## Luke 11: The Lord's Prayer, Beelzebub, and Woes to the Pharisees

Jesus is praying in a certain place, and when he finishes, one of his disciples asks him to teach them to pray, as John also taught his disciples. He gives them a prayer, saying: Father, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, give us day by day our daily bread, forgive us our sins as we forgive every one who is indebted to us, and lead us not into temptation. He tells a parable of a man who goes to his friend at midnight to ask for three loaves because a friend has come to him on a journey and he has nothing to set before him. The friend inside says not to trouble him, for the door is shut and his children are with him in bed. But because of the man's persistence, the friend rises and gives him as many as he needs. Jesus says to ask and it will be given, seek and they will find, knock and it will be opened. He says that if a son asks for bread, a father will not give him a stone, and if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a serpent. If earthly fathers, being evil, know how to give good gifts to their children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.

Jesus casts out a devil that is mute, and the mute man speaks. The people marvel, but some say he casts out devils by Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. Others tempt him by seeking a sign from heaven. Jesus knows their thoughts and speaks about a kingdom divided against itself and a house divided against a house. He asks by whom their sons cast out devils and says that if he casts out devils by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon them. He speaks of the strong man armed who guards his palace and of the stronger one who overcomes him. He says whoever is not with him is against him, and whoever does not gather with him scatters. He tells of an unclean spirit that goes out of a man, wanders through dry places seeking rest, finds none, and returns to find the house swept and garnished. It then brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

A woman from the crowd lifts up her voice and says blessed is the womb that bore him and the breasts that nursed him. Jesus says rather blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it. He speaks to the crowds about seeking a sign and says no sign will be given except the sign of Jonas the prophet. He says the queen of the south will rise up in judgment with the men of that generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and a greater than Solomon is here. He speaks of a candle not being put in a secret place or under a bushel. He says the light of the body is the eye, and when the eye is single, the whole body is full of light, but when the eye is evil, the body is full of darkness.

A Pharisee asks him to dine with him, and Jesus goes in and sits down to eat. The Pharisee marvels that Jesus has not first washed before dinner. Jesus speaks to him, pronouncing woe against the Pharisees for cleaning the outside of the cup and platter while inside they are full of greed and wickedness. He says woe to the Pharisees for tithing mint and rue and every herb while passing over judgment and the love of God. He says woe to them for loving the highest seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets. He says woe to the scribes and Pharisees for being like graves that are not seen, which men walk over without knowing it. A lawyer says Jesus is reproaching them too. Jesus says woe also to the lawyers for loading men with burdens they will not touch themselves. He says woe to them for building the tombs of the prophets whom their fathers killed. He speaks of the wisdom of God sending prophets and apostles, some of whom will be killed and persecuted, so that the blood of all the prophets from the foundation of the world may be required of that generation, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias. He says woe to the lawyers for taking away the key of knowledge. The scribes and the Pharisees begin to press him aggressively and to provoke him to speak about many things, laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth.

## Luke 12: Beware of Hypocrisy, the Rich Fool, and Watchfulness

A crowd of many thousands gathers, so much that they trample on one another. Jesus begins to speak to his disciples first, telling them to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. He says there is nothing covered that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known. Whatever they have spoken in darkness will be heard in the light. He tells them not to fear those who kill the body and after that have nothing more they can do. He tells them to fear the one who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell. He says five sparrows are sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God. Even the hairs of their head are all numbered. They are of more value than many sparrows. Whoever confesses the Son of man before men, the Son of man will also confess before the angels of God. Whoever denies him before men will be denied before the angels. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Ghost will not be forgiven. When they bring them before the synagogues, magistrates, and powers, they are not to worry about what they will say, for the Holy Ghost will teach them in that same hour what they ought to say.

One of the company says to him to tell his brother to divide the inheritance with him. Jesus says, "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?" He tells them to beware of covetousness, for a man's life does not consist of the abundance of the things he possesses. He tells a parable of a rich man whose ground produces plentifully. The man plans to build bigger barns to store his goods and then take his ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God says to him, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?" Jesus says so it is with the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.

He tells his disciples not to worry about their life, what they will eat, or about their body, what they will wear. Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing. He points to the ravens, which neither sow nor reap and have no storehouse or barn, yet God feeds them. He asks which of them by worrying can add one cubit to his stature. He tells them to consider the lilies, how they grow — they do not toil or spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of them. If God so clothes the grass of the field, how much more will he clothe them. He tells them not to seek what they will eat or drink, and not to be of doubtful mind. Their Father knows they need these things. They are to seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to them. He tells them not to fear, for it is the Father's good pleasure to give them the kingdom. He tells them to sell what they have and give alms, to provide themselves bags that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail. Where their treasure is, there their heart will be also.

He tells them to have their loins girded and their lights burning, like men who wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately. Blessed are those servants whom the lord, when he comes, finds watching. He says the lord will gird himself, make them sit down to eat, and come forth and serve them. Whether he comes in the second watch or the third watch, blessed are those servants if he finds them so. He says if the owner of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched. They must also be ready, for the Son of man comes at an hour when they do not expect him. Peter asks whether this parable is for them or for everyone. Jesus speaks of a faithful and wise steward whom his lord makes ruler over his household, and of the servant who says his lord delays his coming and begins to beat the other servants and to eat and drink and be drunk. That servant's lord will come on a day when he does not look for him and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. The servant who knew his lord's will and did not prepare or act according to it will be beaten with many stripes. The one who did not know and committed things worthy of stripes will be beaten with few. To whom much is given, much will be required.

Jesus says he has come to send fire on the earth and wishes it were already kindled. He has a baptism to be baptized with and is pressed until it is accomplished. He says he has not come to give peace on earth but rather division. From now on, five in one house will be divided, three against two and two against three. He tells them they can discern the face of the sky and the earth, but why do they not discern this time. He asks why they do not judge for themselves what is right. He says that as they go with their adversary to the magistrate, they should try to settle the matter on the way, or else the adversary may drag them to the judge, and the judge deliver them to the officer, and the officer throw them into prison.
