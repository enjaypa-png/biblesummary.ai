# Deuteronomy

## Deuteronomy 1: Moses Reviews the Wilderness Journey

Moses speaks to all Israel in the plains of Moab and recalls earlier events. He says the LORD tells Israel to leave Horeb and go toward the land promised to their fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses explains how the people become too numerous for him to manage alone, so leaders are appointed over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and judges are instructed to judge fairly without respect of persons.

Moses recounts the journey to Kadesh-barnea and the sending of spies into the land. He describes how the people become afraid after the spies report strong cities and large people, and how they refuse to go up despite encouragement and reminders of what the LORD does in Egypt and in the wilderness. The LORD becomes angry, declares that the unbelieving generation does not enter the land, and appoints Joshua to lead. Moses says the people then try to go up after the judgment, but they are defeated. Israel remains at Kadesh many days.

## Deuteronomy 2: Journey Around Edom, Moab, and Ammon

Moses describes Israel turning back into the wilderness and traveling for many days around mount Seir. The LORD tells them not to fight Edom, the children of Esau, because their land is given to them; Israel buys food and water instead of taking it. Moses notes the passing of the older generation that the LORD swears does not enter the land, until the men of war are consumed.

Israel then passes by Moab and is told not to fight Moab, the children of Lot, because their land is given to them. Israel also avoids Ammon for the same reason. Moses describes crossing the brook Zered and later passing over Arnon. The LORD gives Sihon king of Heshbon into Israel's hand. Israel asks for peaceful passage, but Sihon refuses and comes out to fight; Israel defeats him, takes his cities, and occupies the land from Arnon to Jabbok, except where the border belongs to Ammon.

## Deuteronomy 3: Og of Bashan and Land East of Jordan

Moses describes the battle with Og king of Bashan. Og comes out with his people, Israel fights, defeats him, and takes his cities, including many fortified towns. Moses notes Og's greatness and mentions his bedstead as a remembered object. Israel takes the land of Bashan and Gilead and assigns it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh, with boundaries described.

Moses says he commands the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh to cross armed before their brothers until the rest of Israel also receives rest and their inheritance. Moses recounts how he pleads with the LORD to let him cross into the good land, but the LORD refuses and tells Moses to strengthen Joshua, because Joshua is the one who will go over. Moses says he remains in the valley over against Beth-peor.

## Deuteronomy 4: Call to Obedience and Cities of Refuge

Moses urges Israel to listen to the statutes and judgments he teaches, so they live and go in and possess the land. He warns them not to add to or take from the commandments. He reminds them of Baal-peor, where those who follow Baal-peor perish, and he says those who cling to the LORD remain alive. He sets cities of refuge on the east side of Jordan for the manslayer to flee to: Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan.

Moses stresses that Israel sees no form when the LORD speaks out of the midst of the fire at Horeb, so they must not make graven images of any likeness. He warns that if they corrupt themselves and worship created things, they perish from the land and be scattered among the nations, serving gods of wood and stone. He also says that from there they seek the LORD and find him when they search with all the heart and soul. He points to the LORD's acts in Egypt and the wonders Israel sees, and he insists the LORD is God, and there is none else. He urges obedience so it goes well with them and their children.

## Deuteronomy 5: The Ten Commandments

Moses calls all Israel and says the LORD makes a covenant with them in Horeb. He recounts how the LORD speaks out of the fire, and how the people, afraid of the fire, ask Moses to hear and then tell them what the LORD says. Moses repeats the Ten Commandments: no other gods, no graven images, not taking the LORD's name in vain, keeping the sabbath day, honoring father and mother, not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not bearing false witness, and not coveting.

Moses repeats that the people fear and stand far off, and the LORD approves their request for a mediator but calls for a heart that fears him and keeps his commandments. Moses tells Israel to walk in all the ways the LORD commands so they live and prosper in the land.

## Deuteronomy 6: The Shema and Love for the LORD

Moses sets the call to fear the LORD, keep his commandments, and teach them to their children. He gives the central confession that the LORD is one and commands love for the LORD with all the heart, soul, and might. He instructs Israel to keep these words in their heart, talk of them in daily life, bind them as a sign, and write them on their doorposts and gates.

Moses warns that when Israel comes into cities they do not build and eats from vineyards they do not plant, they must not forget the LORD who brings them out of Egypt. He forbids following other gods and calls for fearing the LORD and serving him. He says the commandments and statutes are for Israel's righteousness and good, and he instructs them how to answer their children when asked about the meaning of these testimonies and statutes.

## Deuteronomy 7: Destroying the Nations and No Covenant with Them

Moses says that when the LORD brings Israel into the land and casts out many nations, Israel must destroy them and make no covenant with them. He forbids marriages with them because they turn hearts to other gods. He commands destroying altars, images, and groves. Moses says Israel is a holy people chosen by the LORD, not because they are greater, but because the LORD loves them and keeps the oath sworn to their fathers.

Moses describes the LORD as faithful, keeping covenant and mercy, but repaying those who hate him. He promises blessing, fruitfulness, and protection if Israel keeps the commandments. He warns not to be afraid of the nations, and he recalls Egypt's signs and wonders. He says the LORD drives out the nations little by little and gives their kings into Israel's hand. He warns against desiring the silver or gold on idols and calls such things an abomination.

## Deuteronomy 8: Remember the Wilderness; Do Not Forget the LORD

Moses tells Israel to remember the whole way the LORD leads them in the wilderness to humble and prove them. He recalls hunger and manna, teaching that man does not live by bread only. He notes their clothing does not wear out and their feet do not swell. He compares the LORD's discipline to a father correcting a son.

Moses describes the good land with brooks, wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, oil olive, honey, and stones with iron and brass. He warns that after Israel eats and is full and builds good houses, their heart must not be lifted up so they forget the LORD and say their own power gets wealth. He commands remembering that the LORD gives power to get wealth, and he warns that if they forget the LORD and follow other gods, they perish like the nations the LORD destroys.

## Deuteronomy 9: Israel's Stiffneckedness; The Golden Calf

Moses tells Israel they are about to go over Jordan to face great nations with walled cities and the sons of the Anakims. He says the LORD goes before them as a consuming fire. He warns Israel not to say the LORD gives them the land because of their righteousness; instead, the LORD drives out nations for their wickedness and to keep his oath to the fathers.

Moses reminds Israel of their provocations: at Horeb they make the golden calf. Moses recounts going up the mount to receive the tables, staying forty days and nights, and then being shown the people's sin. He describes breaking the tables, pleading for Israel, and calling on the LORD not to destroy them. He mentions Israel's rebellion at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah, and their refusal to go up from Kadesh-barnea. He says Israel is a stiffnecked people.

## Deuteronomy 10: New Tables; Fear and Love the LORD

Moses recounts how the LORD tells him to cut two new tables of stone and make an ark of wood. Moses goes up again, stays forty days and nights, and the LORD writes the same words on the tables and gives them to him. The LORD listens to Moses and does not destroy Israel. Moses notes Aaron's death and the succession of Eleazar, and he describes travel stages.

Moses explains that the LORD separates the tribe of Levi to bear the ark, stand before the LORD to minister, and bless in his name. Moses urges Israel to fear the LORD, walk in his ways, love him, serve him with all heart and soul, and keep his commandments. He says the LORD is God of gods and Lord of lords, mighty and not showing partiality, who loves the stranger and gives him food and clothing. Moses commands love for the stranger and calls for circumcising the heart and not being stiffnecked.

## Deuteronomy 11: Blessing and Curse Set Before Israel

Moses calls Israel to love the LORD and keep his charge, statutes, judgments, and commandments always. He points to what their eyes see: the LORD's acts in Egypt, the judgment on Pharaoh, the opening of the Red sea, and what the LORD does in the wilderness, including the earth swallowing Dathan and Abiram with their households. He says obedience brings strength and long life in the land.

Moses contrasts Egypt's watered fields with the promised land, which drinks water from rain and is cared for by the LORD. He promises rain in its season, grain, wine, oil, and grass for cattle if Israel obeys, but warns of shutting up heaven if they turn to other gods. He commands putting the words on the heart, teaching children, binding them as a sign, and writing them on doorposts. He sets before Israel blessing for obedience and curse for disobedience, and he tells them where the blessing and curse are to be set: on mount Gerizim and mount Ebal.

## Deuteronomy 12: Worship at the Chosen Place

Moses commands Israel to destroy the places where the nations serve their gods: mountains, hills, and trees. He says Israel must not worship the LORD that way. Instead, they seek the place the LORD chooses to put his name, and there they bring burnt offerings, sacrifices, tithes, heave offerings, vows, freewill offerings, and firstlings of herd and flock, and rejoice before the LORD with their households.

Moses permits eating meat within their gates as the LORD blesses them, but forbids eating blood and commands pouring it on the earth. He instructs that holy things and vows are brought to the chosen place. He warns against being trapped by the nations' ways after they are destroyed and forbids adopting their worship practices, including their abominations. He commands doing what the LORD commands without adding or subtracting.

## Deuteronomy 13: Guarding Against Idolatry

Moses describes tests that come through a prophet or dreamer who gives a sign and then urges following other gods. Even if the sign comes to pass, Israel must not listen, because the LORD proves them to know if they love him. He commands putting such a deceiver to death for turning people from the LORD.

Moses also addresses a close family member or friend who secretly urges serving other gods. He commands not consenting, not hiding it, and being the first to cast a stone. He then describes a city led into idolatry and commands careful inquiry; if it is true, the city is destroyed, everything is burned, and it remains a heap, with nothing from the cursed thing kept. He says the LORD turns from the fierceness of his anger when Israel obeys.

## Deuteronomy 14: Clean and Unclean; Tithing

Moses calls Israel the children of the LORD and forbids self-cutting and shaving between the eyes for the dead. He lists clean animals and forbids unclean ones; he describes clean fish and forbids certain birds, and forbids eating anything that dies of itself, though it may be given or sold to a stranger. He repeats that Israel is a holy people.

Moses commands a tithe of the increase of seed, wine, and oil and the firstlings of herds and flocks, eaten before the LORD in the place he chooses, so Israel learns to fear the LORD always. If the way is too long, the tithe is turned into money and brought to the chosen place to buy what they desire to eat and rejoice. He commands the tithe of the third year be stored within their gates for the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.

## Deuteronomy 15: Release, Generosity, and Firstlings

Moses commands a release of debts at the end of every seven years, so a creditor releases what is lent to a brother, though it may be required of a foreigner. He says there should be no poor among them if they obey, yet he also says the poor are never fully absent, so Israel must open the hand to a poor brother and lend enough for his need.

Moses commands releasing a Hebrew servant in the seventh year and sending him away with generous provision from flock, floor, and winepress, remembering Israel's redemption from Egypt. If the servant chooses to stay, a sign of permanent service is made. Moses commands setting apart the firstlings of herd and flock to the LORD, not working the firstling ox or shearing the firstling sheep, and eating it before the LORD; if it has a blemish, it is eaten within the gates, but the blood is not eaten.

## Deuteronomy 16: Appointed Feasts and Judges

Moses commands keeping the Passover in the month Abib and sacrificing the passover in the place the LORD chooses, eating unleavened bread seven days, and keeping a solemn assembly. He commands counting seven weeks from the start of harvest and keeping the feast of weeks, rejoicing with family, Levites, strangers, fatherless, and widows. He commands keeping the feast of tabernacles seven days after gathering in from floor and winepress, rejoicing, and remembering inclusion of the Levite and the needy.

Moses commands that all males appear before the LORD three times a year at the chosen place and not appear empty. He then commands appointing judges and officers in all gates to judge with just judgment, refusing bribes and perverting justice. He forbids planting a grove near the altar of the LORD and forbids setting up an image.

## Deuteronomy 17: Justice, Kingship, and Higher Courts

Moses forbids sacrificing to the LORD any animal with blemish. He commands that if a man or woman serves other gods and it is proven, that person is stoned, with witnesses initiating the execution; he requires two or three witnesses. He establishes a higher court at the place the LORD chooses for hard cases and commands obeying the sentence of the priests the Levites and the judge there, refusing rebellion against the decision.

Moses then gives laws for a king Israel may set over them: the king must be one from among their brethren, not a stranger. He must not multiply horses, cause people to return to Egypt, multiply wives, or greatly multiply silver and gold. He must write a copy of the law, read it all his days, fear the LORD, keep the words, and not lift his heart above his brethren.

## Deuteronomy 18: Priests, Levites, and True Prophecy

Moses states that the priests the Levites and all the tribe of Levi have no inheritance of land, but eat the offerings of the LORD, and the LORD is their inheritance. He explains portions for priests from sacrifices and mentions firstfruits. He also provides for a Levite who comes from any gate in Israel to the chosen place; he may minister like his brethren and eat equal portions.

Moses forbids learning the abominations of the nations: passing children through fire, divination, observing times, enchantments, witchcraft, charms, consulting familiar spirits, wizards, and necromancers. He says the LORD raises up a Prophet from among their brethren like Moses, and the people must listen. He gives the test for a prophet: if a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and the thing does not happen, that word is not from the LORD; Israel must not fear that prophet.

## Deuteronomy 19: Cities of Refuge and Justice Rules

Moses commands setting apart three cities in the land the LORD gives, preparing the way, so the manslayer who kills unintentionally can flee there. He describes the case of accidental killing and the need to protect the manslayer from the avenger of blood until judgment. If the LORD enlarges their coast, three more cities are added, for a total of six.

Moses commands not removing a neighbor's landmark. He establishes that one witness is not enough; two or three witnesses establish a matter. He warns against false witnesses and commands doing to the false witness as he thinks to do to his brother. He states the principle of measured justice: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

## Deuteronomy 20: War Rules

Moses instructs Israel on going to battle: they must not fear horses and chariots, because the LORD is with them. The priest speaks to encourage the people. Officers then release certain men: one who builds a new house and has not dedicated it, one who plants a vineyard and has not eaten of it, one who is betrothed and has not taken his wife, and one who is fearful and fainthearted.

Moses commands offering peace to a city far away; if it accepts, it becomes tributary. If it refuses, Israel besieges it, and when the LORD delivers it, the males are killed, but women, children, cattle, and spoil are taken. For the cities of these nations in the promised land, Israel is to save alive nothing that breathes, to avoid learning abominations. He forbids destroying fruit trees during a siege, allowing use of non-fruit trees for siege works.

## Deuteronomy 21: Unsolved Murder, Family Order, and the Executed Man

Moses gives a procedure for an unknown murderer found in the field: elders and judges measure to the nearest city. That city's elders take a heifer, bring it to a valley with running water, break its neck, and wash their hands over it, declaring they do not know who kills the man. The priests the Levites oversee and pronounce. The goal is removing blood guilt from Israel.

Moses gives rules for a captive woman a man desires for a wife: she mourns and is given time; if later she does not please him, he lets her go free and does not sell her. He commands that the firstborn son receives a double portion even if the father loves another wife more. He addresses a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey; if parents bring him to elders and the matter is proven, the men of the city stone him. He ends with the rule that if a man is hanged for a sin worthy of death, his body is not left all night on the tree but buried the same day.

## Deuteronomy 22: Community Responsibility, Sexual Cases, and Marriage Laws

Moses commands helping a brother with lost animals and fallen burdens, not hiding from the need. He forbids cross-dressing. He commands kindness toward a bird nest: taking the young but letting the dam go. He commands building a battlement on the roof to avoid blood guilt. He forbids mixing seed in a vineyard, plowing with ox and ass together, and wearing a garment of wool and linen together. He commands making fringes on garments.

Moses then gives laws for sexual and marriage cases. He describes a husband accusing his wife of not being a virgin; if the accusation is false, he is punished and cannot divorce her; if true, she is stoned at her father's house. He commands death for adultery with a married woman. He distinguishes cases involving a betrothed virgin in a city versus in the field, describing when both die and when only the man dies. He commands death for a man who lies with a woman not betrothed, and requires marriage with a bride price with no right to put her away. He forbids a man taking his father's wife.

## Deuteronomy 23: Who Enters the Congregation; Purity and Social Rules

Moses gives restrictions about entering the congregation of the LORD, including one wounded in the stones, a bastard, an Ammonite or Moabite, and he gives the reason regarding Moab and Ammon not meeting Israel with bread and water and hiring Balaam. He commands not seeking their peace or prosperity. He allows Edomites and Egyptians to enter in the third generation, and he says children born to them may enter then.

Moses commands camp cleanliness and rules for bodily uncleanness. He forbids delivering a runaway servant back to his master and commands letting him dwell where he chooses. He forbids prostitution and bringing such wages into the house of the LORD. He commands lending without interest to a brother but allows interest from a stranger. He commands paying vows promptly. He permits eating grapes or grain by hand in a neighbor's field but forbids taking a vessel or sickle to harvest.

## Deuteronomy 24: Divorce Limits, Fairness, and Care for the Vulnerable

Moses regulates divorce: a man gives a bill of divorcement and sends the woman away; if she becomes another man's wife and is divorced again or widowed, the first husband cannot take her again, calling it an abomination. He exempts a newly married man from war and charges for one year to cheer his wife.

Moses forbids taking a millstone as pledge, because it takes a man's life to pledge it. He commands death for kidnapping an Israelite to sell him. He commands carefulness regarding the plague of leprosy, remembering what the LORD does to Miriam. He commands not entering a house to take a pledge but waiting outside; he commands returning a poor man's pledge at night. He commands paying wages on time to a hired servant, forbids perverting judgment for the stranger, fatherless, and widow, and commands leaving gleanings in harvest, olives, and vineyards for the stranger, fatherless, and widow, remembering Israel's slavery in Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 25: Disputes, Family Duty, and Honest Weights

Moses commands that if there is a dispute and men are judged, the wicked are beaten by measure, not exceeding forty stripes. He commands not muzzling the ox when it treads out corn.

Moses establishes levirate marriage: if brethren dwell together and one dies without a child, the widow is not married outside; the living brother takes her, and the firstborn she bears raises the name of the dead. If the man refuses, the widow brings the matter to elders, and there is a public act of shame. He forbids a woman's violent grasp in a fight with a specific penalty. He commands honest weights and measures. He commands remembering what Amalek does to Israel by the way and to blot out the remembrance of Amalek when the LORD gives rest.

## Deuteronomy 26: Firstfruits and Tithes; Covenant Affirmation

Moses commands that when Israel comes into the land and takes possession, they bring firstfruits in a basket to the priest at the chosen place. The worshiper makes a formal declaration recounting the family's descent into Egypt, affliction there, and deliverance by the LORD with a mighty hand, and then rejoices with the Levite and the stranger.

Moses commands a declaration after the third-year tithe is set aside for the Levite, stranger, fatherless, and widow, stating the giver does not eat it in mourning, remove it for unclean use, or offer it for the dead. Moses repeats that Israel is the LORD's peculiar people, and calls for keeping all commandments. Israel avouches the LORD to be their God, and the LORD avouches Israel to be his people, set high above all nations in praise, name, and honor.

## Deuteronomy 27: Curses on Mount Ebal

Moses and the elders command Israel to keep all the commandments and, after crossing Jordan, to set up great stones, plaster them, and write on them all the words of this law. They are to build an altar of whole stones on mount Ebal and offer burnt offerings and peace offerings, eating and rejoicing before the LORD.

Moses and the priests the Levites command silence and attention. He directs that six tribes stand to bless on mount Gerizim and six tribes stand to curse on mount Ebal. The Levites speak a series of curses for secret idolatry, dishonoring parents, moving landmarks, misleading the blind, perverting judgment for the vulnerable, sexual sins, smiting a neighbor secretly, taking a reward to slay the innocent, and not confirming the words of the law. The people answer "Amen" to each.

## Deuteronomy 28: Blessings and Curses

Moses sets out blessings that follow obedience: exaltation above nations, blessing in city and field, fruitful womb, ground, cattle, and flocks, blessed basket and store, victory over enemies, holiness as the LORD establishes them, and prosperity with rain in due season. He describes Israel as the head and not the tail, lending and not borrowing, if they obey and do not turn aside to other gods.

Moses then describes curses for disobedience in extensive detail: trouble in city and field, disease, drought, defeat, and scattering. He describes siege conditions, famine, and terror, including desperation within besieged cities. He speaks of being removed into captivity, serving other gods, becoming a proverb and byword, losing family and possessions, and suffering oppression. He describes a nation from far away coming like an eagle, harsh and unpitying, and he ends with warnings of plagues and destruction until Israel is few in number.

## Deuteronomy 29: Covenant Renewal

Moses gathers all Israel in Moab: captains, elders, officers, men, women, children, and the stranger in the camp. He recalls what their eyes see in Egypt and the wilderness, and he says the LORD does not give them a heart to perceive, eyes to see, and ears to hear until that day. He recounts how their clothes and shoes do not wear out and how they do not eat bread or drink wine, so they know the LORD is their God. He recalls victories over Sihon and Og and the gift of their land to Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh.

Moses warns against a root that bears gall and wormwood: any man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away to serve other gods. He describes a person who blesses himself in his heart while walking in stubbornness, and he says the LORD does not spare him. He warns that the LORD's anger and jealousy smoke against that person and that the written curses come upon him. Moses describes future generations and foreigners seeing the plagues of the land and asking why; the answer is that Israel forsakes the covenant and goes after other gods. He ends with the statement that secret things belong to the LORD, but revealed things belong to Israel to do all the words of the law.

## Deuteronomy 30: Return and Choose Life

Moses says that after blessing and curse come upon Israel, and they call them to mind among the nations where the LORD drives them, they return to the LORD and obey his voice. He says the LORD has compassion, gathers them again, and brings them into the land, blessing them and multiplying them. He describes the LORD circumcising their heart and the heart of their seed, so they love the LORD and live.

Moses says the commandment is not hidden or far off, not in heaven or beyond the sea, but very near, in their mouth and heart, so they can do it. He sets before them life and good, death and evil. He calls heaven and earth to record, urging them to choose life by loving the LORD, obeying his voice, and cleaving to him, so they dwell in the land sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## Deuteronomy 31: Moses' Final Charge and the Song

Moses speaks to all Israel and says he is one hundred and twenty years old and cannot go over Jordan. He says the LORD goes over before them, and Joshua goes over before them, and he urges strength and courage. Moses writes the law and delivers it to the priests the sons of Levi who bear the ark of the covenant and to all the elders. He commands that every seven years, at the release in the feast of tabernacles, the law is read before all Israel, including women, children, and the stranger, so they hear and learn.

The LORD speaks to Moses and Joshua in the tabernacle, appearing in a pillar of cloud. The LORD tells Moses that after his death the people turn to other gods, break the covenant, and face anger and many evils. The LORD commands Moses to write a song as a witness against Israel. Moses finishes writing the words of the law and commands the Levites to put the book of the law by the side of the ark. Moses calls heaven and earth to witness and says he knows Israel will corrupt themselves after his death. He then speaks in the ears of all the congregation the words of the song.

## Deuteronomy 32: The Song of Moses

Moses delivers the song, calling heaven and earth to hear. He speaks of the LORD's name, greatness, and perfect ways, and he describes Israel's corruption and unfaithfulness. He recalls the LORD's care: finding Israel in a desert land, keeping him as the apple of his eye, and carrying him as an eagle bears its young. He describes Israel growing full and turning to strange gods, sacrificing to devils and gods they do not know, and provoking the LORD.

The song describes the LORD's response: hiding his face, bringing calamities, and using a foolish nation to provoke Israel. It speaks of Israel's enemies and their false confidence, and it declares that vengeance and recompense belong to the LORD. It portrays judgment on adversaries and mercy toward his people. Moses finishes the song and urges Israel to set their hearts to all the words, because it is their life and their length of days in the land. The LORD tells Moses to go up into mount Nebo to view the land and to die there, because Moses trespasses at the waters of Meribah-kadesh and does not sanctify the LORD in the midst of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 33: Moses Blesses the Tribes

Moses blesses the children of Israel before his death. He describes the LORD coming from Sinai with saints and law, and he speaks of the LORD's love for the people. Moses gives blessings tribe by tribe, speaking over Reuben, Judah, Levi, Benjamin, Joseph, Zebulun, Issachar, Gad, Dan, Naphtali, and Asher, with language about strength, protection, and portions of land and resources.

Moses ends with praise of Israel's blessed state: no god is like the God of Jeshurun, who rides upon the heavens to help. He calls the LORD the eternal God and the everlasting arms as refuge. He says Israel dwells in safety, with a land of corn and wine, and the heavens drop down dew. He declares Israel happy, saved by the LORD, with enemies submitting and Israel treading on their high places.

## Deuteronomy 34: The Death of Moses

Moses goes up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, over against Jericho. The LORD shows him all the land: Gilead to Dan, Naphtali, Ephraim and Manasseh, Judah to the utmost sea, the south, and the plain of Jericho to Zoar. The LORD tells Moses this is the land sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses sees it but does not go over.

Moses dies there in the land of Moab, and the LORD buries him in a valley, and no man knows his sepulchre to that day. Moses is one hundred and twenty years old, his eye is not dim, and his natural force is not abated. The children of Israel mourn thirty days. Joshua the son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses lays his hands on him, and Israel listens to Joshua. The book closes by saying there arises not a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knows face to face, and it recalls the signs and wonders the LORD sends him to do in Egypt and the great acts he performs before all Israel.
