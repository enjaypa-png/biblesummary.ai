# Song of Solomon

## Song of Solomon 1: Longing for the Beloved

The woman speaks first. She longs for the kisses of the man she loves and says his love is better than wine. She speaks of his name as fragrant perfume and says the virgins love him. She asks him to draw her away so they may run together. She says the king brings her into his chambers, and the daughters of Jerusalem speak of rejoicing and remembering his love more than wine. The woman says she is dark but beautiful, like the tents of Kedar and the curtains of Solomon. She asks the daughters of Jerusalem not to stare at her because the sun has darkened her. She explains that her brothers were angry with her and made her keep the vineyards, but she has not kept her own vineyard.

She asks the man she loves where he feeds his flock and where he makes it rest at noon, so she does not wander among the flocks of his companions. The man answers and tells her to follow the tracks of the flock and feed her young goats beside the shepherds’ tents. He compares her to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots and praises her cheeks and neck with ornaments of gold and silver. The woman says that while the king sits at his table, her perfume spreads its fragrance. She calls her beloved a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of henna in the vineyards of En-gedi. He calls her beautiful and says her eyes are like doves. She answers that he is handsome and pleasant, and she describes their bed as green and their house beams as cedar and fir.

## Song of Solomon 2: His Banner Over Me Is Love

The woman describes herself as a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys. The man responds that she is like a lily among thorns compared to other women. She says he is like an apple tree among the trees of the forest. She delights to sit in his shadow and taste his fruit. She says he brings her into the house of wine and his banner over her is love. She asks to be supported with raisins and refreshed with apples because she is lovesick. She describes his left hand under her head and his right hand embracing her. She charges the daughters of Jerusalem not to awaken love before it pleases.

She hears the voice of her beloved coming over mountains and hills like a gazelle or young deer. He stands behind the wall, looking through the windows. He calls her to rise and come away, saying winter is past, flowers appear, birds sing, and the fig tree and vines give fragrance. He calls her his dove in the clefts of the rock and asks to see her face and hear her voice. There is a call to catch the little foxes that spoil the vineyards. The woman says her beloved is hers and she is his, and he feeds among the lilies. She asks him to turn and be like a gazelle or young deer upon the mountains of separation.

## Song of Solomon 3: Seeking and Finding

The woman speaks of seeking her beloved at night on her bed. She looks for him but does not find him. She rises and goes through the city streets and broad ways, asking the watchmen if they have seen the one she loves. Shortly after passing them, she finds him and holds him, refusing to let him go until she brings him into her mother’s house, into the chamber of the one who conceived her. She again charges the daughters of Jerusalem not to awaken love before it pleases.

A scene appears of a procession coming up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense. It is Solomon’s carriage, surrounded by sixty mighty men of Israel, each holding a sword because of fear in the night. King Solomon makes a chariot from the wood of Lebanon, with pillars of silver, a bottom of gold, and a covering of purple, paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem. The daughters of Zion are called to go out and see King Solomon with the crown his mother places on him in the day of his wedding and the gladness of his heart.

## Song of Solomon 4: The Locked Garden

The man praises the woman’s beauty in detail. He calls her beautiful and says her eyes are like doves behind her veil. He compares her hair to a flock of goats descending Mount Gilead and her teeth to a flock of sheep newly washed. He describes her lips like a scarlet thread and her mouth as lovely. He compares her temples to a piece of pomegranate and her neck to the tower of David built for armor. He describes her two breasts like twin young deer that feed among the lilies. He speaks of going to the mountain of myrrh until the day breaks and shadows flee.

He says she is entirely beautiful with no flaw. He calls her to come with him from Lebanon and describes how she has captured his heart. He praises her love as better than wine and her lips as dripping honey. He calls her a locked garden and a sealed fountain, describing her as a garden with pomegranates, spices, and fragrant trees. The woman responds, calling on the north and south winds to blow upon her garden so its spices may flow out. She invites her beloved to come into his garden and eat its pleasant fruits.

## Song of Solomon 5: Lovesick for Her Beloved

The man says he comes into his garden, gathers myrrh and spice, eats honeycomb and honey, and drinks wine and milk. A voice invites others to eat and drink deeply of love. The woman speaks again and says she sleeps, but her heart is awake. She hears her beloved knocking and calling her his sister and dove, asking her to open to him because his head is wet with dew. She hesitates, saying she has put off her garment and washed her feet. When he reaches for the door, her feelings stir. She rises to open, and her hands drip with myrrh on the handles of the lock.

When she opens, her beloved has withdrawn and gone. She searches for him but does not find him. She calls him, but he gives no answer. The watchmen who patrol the city find her, strike her, and take away her veil. She charges the daughters of Jerusalem that if they find her beloved, they should tell him she is lovesick. The daughters ask what makes her beloved different from others. She describes him in detail: his head like fine gold, his hair black and wavy, his eyes like doves by streams of water, his cheeks like beds of spices, his lips like lilies, his hands like gold set with jewels, his body like ivory overlaid with sapphires, his legs like marble pillars, his appearance like Lebanon, and his mouth most sweet. She declares he is altogether lovely and calls him her beloved and her friend.

## Song of Solomon 6: Unique and Beautiful

The daughters of Jerusalem ask where her beloved has gone so they may seek him with her. The woman answers that he has gone down to his garden, to feed in the gardens and gather lilies. She says she belongs to her beloved and he belongs to her. The man speaks and calls her beautiful as Tirzah and Jerusalem, majestic as an army with banners. He asks her to turn her eyes away because they overcome him. He repeats descriptions of her hair, teeth, and temples, and says queens and concubines praise her.

He describes seeing her as the only one of her mother, chosen and favored. The daughters call her blessed and praise her beauty. A scene describes going down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants and budding vines. The woman speaks of being taken unaware among the chariots of Ammi-nadib. The daughters call her to return so they may look upon her, and a question is asked about what is seen in the Shulamite, comparing her to the dance of two companies.

## Song of Solomon 7: Delighting in Love

The man continues praising the woman, beginning with her feet in sandals and describing her thighs, navel, waist, breasts, neck, eyes, nose, and head. He compares her stature to a palm tree and says he will take hold of its branches. He speaks of her breath like apples and her mouth like the best wine. The woman responds that the wine goes down smoothly for her beloved, moving gently over lips and teeth. She says she belongs to her beloved and his desire is toward her.

She invites him to go into the field and lodge in the villages, to rise early and see if the vines flourish and pomegranates bloom. There she promises to give him her love. She speaks of mandrakes giving fragrance and of pleasant fruits laid up for him. She refers to both new and old treasures she has stored for her beloved.

## Song of Solomon 8: Love Is Strong as Death

The woman wishes her beloved were like a brother so she could kiss him openly without shame. She says she would lead him to her mother’s house and give him spiced wine and juice of pomegranates. She describes again his left hand under her head and his right hand embracing her. She charges the daughters of Jerusalem not to awaken love before it pleases. A voice asks who comes up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved. She speaks of stirring him under the apple tree where his mother bore him.

She asks him to set her as a seal upon his heart and arm, saying love is strong as death and jealousy fierce as the grave. She says many waters cannot quench love, nor floods drown it, and that if a man offered all his wealth for love, it would be rejected. A discussion follows about a little sister who has no breasts and what will be done for her when she is spoken for. The answer describes building upon her if she is a wall, or enclosing her if she is a door. The woman says she is a wall and her breasts like towers, and she finds favor in his eyes.

She mentions Solomon having a vineyard at Baal-hamon, leased to keepers who bring silver for its fruit. She says her own vineyard is before her, and she speaks of giving Solomon his portion and the keepers theirs. The beloved calls to her, asking to hear her voice. She answers by asking him to hurry and be like a gazelle or young deer upon the mountains of spices.
