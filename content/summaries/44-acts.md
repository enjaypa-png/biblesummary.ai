# Acts

## Acts 1: The Ascension and the Choosing of Matthias

Jesus shows himself alive to the apostles after his suffering, speaking about the kingdom of God. He commands them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Father, saying they will be baptized with the Holy Ghost soon. They ask if he will restore the kingdom to Israel, and he tells them it is not for them to know the times, but they will receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon them and will be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. As they watch, he is taken up, and a cloud receives him out of their sight. Two men in white apparel tell them that this same Jesus will return in the same way they have seen him go.

The apostles return to Jerusalem and continue in prayer with the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brethren. Peter stands up among about one hundred twenty disciples and speaks about Judas Iscariot, who guided those who took Jesus and later died after falling headlong and bursting open. Peter says Scripture must be fulfilled and that another must take his office. They choose between Joseph called Barsabas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias. After prayer, they cast lots, and the lot falls on Matthias, who is numbered with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2: The Day of Pentecost

On the day of Pentecost, the disciples are all together when a sound like a rushing mighty wind fills the house. Cloven tongues like fire appear and sit upon each of them, and they are filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak in other tongues. Devout Jews from many nations hear them speaking in their own languages about the wonderful works of God. Some are amazed; others mock and say they are full of new wine.

Peter stands with the eleven and says they are not drunk but that this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel about God pouring out his Spirit. He speaks of Jesus of Nazareth, delivered by God's plan and crucified by wicked hands, whom God raises from the dead. He cites David and says God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ. The people ask what to do. Peter tells them to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and they will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. About three thousand are added. The believers continue in the apostles' doctrine, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers, and they have all things common, praising God daily.

## Acts 3: The Healing at the Beautiful Gate

Peter and John go to the temple at the hour of prayer. A man lame from his mother's womb asks for alms at the gate called Beautiful. Peter tells him to look at them and says he has no silver or gold but gives him what he has: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk. He takes him by the hand, and the man stands, walks, and enters the temple leaping and praising God. The people recognize him and are filled with wonder.

Peter tells the crowd that the power does not come from them but from Jesus, whom they delivered up and denied before Pilate. He says they killed the Prince of life, whom God raises from the dead, and that faith in his name makes this man strong. He calls them to repent so their sins may be blotted out and says Moses and all the prophets spoke of these days. He tells them they are the children of the prophets and of the covenant with Abraham, and that God sends his Son to bless them by turning every one from his iniquities.

## Acts 4: Peter and John Before the Council

The priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees come upon Peter and John and arrest them for teaching the people and preaching through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. Many who hear believe, and the number of men grows to about five thousand. The next day, rulers, elders, and scribes, including Annas the high priest and Caiaphas, ask by what power they have done this. Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, says the man stands whole by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom they crucified and whom God raises from the dead. He says salvation is in no other.

Seeing the boldness of Peter and John and the healed man standing with them, the council commands them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus. Peter and John answer that they must obey God rather than men. After threatening them, the council lets them go. The believers pray for boldness, and the place is shaken; they speak the word with boldness. The multitude is of one heart and soul, sharing possessions. Barnabas sells land and lays the money at the apostles' feet.

## Acts 5: Ananias and Sapphira, and the Apostles' Boldness

Ananias and Sapphira sell a possession but keep back part of the price while claiming to give all. Peter says Ananias lies to the Holy Ghost and to God. Ananias falls down and dies. Later Sapphira comes in, repeats the lie, and also falls down dead. Great fear comes upon all.

Many signs and wonders are done by the apostles. The high priest and the Sadducees imprison them, but an angel of the Lord opens the prison doors at night and tells them to speak in the temple. They do so. The council sends for them and finds the prison secure but empty. They are brought before the council, and Peter says they must obey God rather than men and that God raises Jesus, whom they slew and hanged on a tree. The council considers killing them, but Gamaliel, a Pharisee, advises caution, citing past movements that failed. They beat the apostles and command them not to speak in the name of Jesus. The apostles depart rejoicing that they are counted worthy to suffer shame and continue daily teaching and preaching.

## Acts 6: The Choosing of the Seven and Stephen's Arrest

As the number of disciples multiplies, a complaint arises from the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows are neglected in the daily ministration. The twelve call the multitude and ask them to choose seven men of honest report to oversee this work so the apostles can give themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word. They choose Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch. The apostles pray and lay hands on them.

Stephen, full of faith and power, does great wonders and disputes with men of the synagogue of the Libertines and others. They cannot resist his wisdom, so they stir up false witnesses who accuse him of speaking against Moses and against God. They bring him before the council, and all who sit there see his face as the face of an angel.

## Acts 7: Stephen's Speech and Martyrdom

Stephen answers the high priest by recounting Israel's history, speaking of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses. He describes how Joseph is sold into Egypt and how God is with him. He speaks of Moses' birth, his attempt to deliver Israel, his flight to Midian, and the burning bush where God speaks to him. He tells how Israel rejects Moses and turns to idols, and how God gives them up. He mentions the tabernacle of witness and the temple built by Solomon, saying the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands.

Stephen calls his hearers stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, accusing them of resisting the Holy Ghost as their fathers did and of betraying and murdering the Just One. They are cut to the heart and gnash on him with their teeth. Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, sees the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. They stone him. As he dies, he calls upon Jesus to receive his spirit and asks that this sin not be laid to their charge. Saul consents to his death.

## Acts 8: The Gospel Spreads to Samaria and Ethiopia

A great persecution arises against the church in Jerusalem, and believers are scattered throughout Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. Saul makes havoc of the church, entering houses and committing men and women to prison. Philip goes down to Samaria and preaches Christ. Unclean spirits come out, and many are healed. There is great joy in that city.

Simon, a sorcerer, believes and is baptized, amazed at the miracles. Peter and John come from Jerusalem, lay hands on the believers, and they receive the Holy Ghost. Simon offers money to buy this power, and Peter rebukes him, saying his heart is not right. Philip later meets an Ethiopian eunuch, a man of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, reading Esaias. Philip explains the scripture about the suffering servant and preaches Jesus. The eunuch is baptized. The Spirit catches Philip away, and he is found at Azotus, preaching until he comes to Caesarea.

## Acts 9: The Conversion of Saul

Saul, still breathing threats against the disciples, goes to Damascus with authority from the high priest. A light from heaven shines around him, and he falls to the earth, hearing a voice asking why he persecutes. The voice says, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." Saul is blinded and led into Damascus. The Lord speaks in a vision to Ananias, telling him to go to Saul. Ananias hesitates but obeys, lays hands on Saul, and says he will receive sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. Saul's sight returns; he is baptized and begins preaching that Jesus is the Son of God.

The Jews plot to kill him, but the disciples lower him in a basket through a wall. Saul comes to Jerusalem, and Barnabas brings him to the apostles. Saul speaks boldly in the name of the Lord. The church has rest and is multiplied. Peter heals Aeneas at Lydda and raises Dorcas, also called Tabitha, from the dead in Joppa. Many believe, and Peter stays with Simon a tanner.

## Acts 10: Peter and Cornelius

Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, is a devout man who fears God. An angel appears to him and tells him his prayers are heard and to send for Simon Peter at Joppa. Meanwhile, Peter sees a vision of a sheet descending from heaven with all kinds of animals and hears a voice telling him to rise, kill, and eat. Peter refuses, but the voice says what God has cleansed, do not call common. This happens three times.

Men sent by Cornelius arrive, and Peter goes with them to Caesarea. Cornelius gathers his relatives and friends. Peter says God shows him not to call any man common or unclean. Cornelius tells of the angel's message. Peter speaks of Jesus, how he goes about doing good and is slain and raised on the third day. While Peter speaks, the Holy Ghost falls on all who hear, and they speak with tongues and magnify God. Peter commands them to be baptized.

## Acts 11: The Church at Antioch

Peter returns to Jerusalem, and those of the circumcision question him for going in to uncircumcised men. Peter recounts the vision and how the Holy Ghost falls on Cornelius' household. He says God gives them the same gift as to the apostles. When they hear this, they glorify God.

Believers scattered after Stephen's death preach to Jews only, but some men of Cyprus and Cyrene speak to Grecians in Antioch, preaching the Lord Jesus. A great number believes. The church in Jerusalem sends Barnabas to Antioch. He sees the grace of God and exhorts them. He goes to Tarsus to seek Saul and brings him to Antioch, where they teach for a year. The disciples are first called Christians in Antioch. Agabus prophesies a famine, and the disciples send relief to Judaea by Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12: Peter's Deliverance and Herod's Death

Herod the king stretches out his hand to vex the church and kills James the brother of John with the sword. Seeing it pleases the Jews, he arrests Peter during the days of unleavened bread. Peter is kept in prison, but prayer is made for him. An angel appears at night, chains fall off, and Peter is led out past the guards. He comes to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname is Mark. Rhoda hears his voice but forgets to open the gate at first. Peter tells them what happened and departs.

Herod searches for Peter and, not finding him, executes the guards. Later Herod gives a speech, and the people shout that it is the voice of a god. Immediately the angel of the Lord smites him, and he is eaten of worms and dies. The word of God grows. Barnabas and Saul return from Jerusalem with John Mark.

## Acts 13–14: The First Missionary Journey

In Antioch, the Holy Ghost says to separate Barnabas and Saul for the work to which he has called them. They travel to Cyprus with John Mark. In Paphos they confront Elymas the sorcerer; Paul rebukes him, and Elymas is struck with blindness. Sergius Paulus believes. They go to Perga, and John Mark departs to Jerusalem. In Antioch in Pisidia, Paul speaks in the synagogue, recounting Israel's history and declaring that through Jesus is preached forgiveness of sins. Many believe, but others contradict and stir up persecution, and Paul and Barnabas turn to the Gentiles.

In Iconium, they speak boldly, and many believe, but a plot arises to stone them. In Lystra, Paul heals a man lame from birth. The people call Barnabas Jupiter and Paul Mercurius and attempt to offer sacrifice. Paul and Barnabas restrain them. Jews from Antioch and Iconium persuade the people to stone Paul; they drag him out of the city, supposing he is dead, but he rises and continues. They return to strengthen the disciples and appoint elders in every church before returning to Antioch.

## Acts 15: The Jerusalem Council

Certain men from Judaea teach that unless Gentiles are circumcised after the manner of Moses, they cannot be saved. Paul and Barnabas dispute with them and go to Jerusalem. The apostles and elders meet. Peter speaks of Cornelius and says God makes no difference between them. Paul and Barnabas declare what miracles God works among the Gentiles. James answers, citing the prophets, and says they should not trouble the Gentiles but ask them to abstain from idols, fornication, things strangled, and blood.

They send Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch with a letter stating these decisions. The believers rejoice. After some time, Paul proposes visiting the brethren again. Barnabas wants to take John Mark, but Paul refuses because he departed earlier. They part company: Barnabas takes Mark to Cyprus, and Paul chooses Silas and departs.

## Acts 16: The Philippian Jailer

Paul comes to Derbe and Lystra and meets Timothy, whose mother is a Jewess and father a Greek. Paul circumcises Timothy because of the Jews. They deliver the decrees from Jerusalem to the churches. A vision appears to Paul at night of a man of Macedonia asking for help. They go to Philippi. Lydia, a seller of purple, believes and is baptized.

Paul casts a spirit of divination out of a damsel, and her masters accuse Paul and Silas. They are beaten and imprisoned. At midnight they pray and sing; an earthquake opens the doors. The jailer is about to kill himself, but Paul stops him. The jailer asks what to do to be saved. Paul tells him to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. He and his household are baptized. The magistrates send to release them; Paul insists on a public release since they are Roman citizens.

## Acts 17: Thessalonica, Berea, and Athens

In Thessalonica, Paul reasons in the synagogue for three sabbath days, explaining from the scriptures that Christ must suffer and rise. Some believe, including Greeks and chief women. Unbelieving Jews stir up a mob and accuse Jason of harboring them and acting against Caesar by saying there is another king, Jesus. Paul and Silas are sent away to Berea. There, many believe, but Jews from Thessalonica come and stir up the people.

Paul goes to Athens while Silas and Timothy remain behind. His spirit is stirred when he sees the city given to idolatry. He disputes in the synagogue and marketplace. Brought to the Areopagus, he speaks of the altar to the unknown god and says God commands all men everywhere to repent, having appointed a day to judge the world by a man he has raised from the dead. Some mock; others believe, including Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris.

## Acts 18: Paul in Corinth

Paul comes to Corinth and meets Aquila and Priscilla, Jews recently come from Italy. He works with them as a tentmaker and reasons in the synagogue. When Silas and Timothy arrive, Paul testifies that Jesus is Christ. The Jews oppose him, and he says he will go to the Gentiles. He stays with Justus, and Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believes. The Lord speaks to Paul in a vision, telling him not to fear but to speak, for no man will hurt him. He stays a year and six months.

The Jews bring Paul before Gallio the deputy of Achaia, accusing him of persuading men to worship God contrary to the law. Gallio refuses to judge the matter. Paul later sails toward Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, stopping briefly in Ephesus. He leaves them there and travels to Caesarea, Jerusalem, and Antioch. Apollos, an eloquent man from Alexandria, comes to Ephesus, knowing only the baptism of John. Priscilla and Aquila explain to him more perfectly. He goes to Achaia and helps those who believe.

## Acts 19: The Riot in Ephesus

Paul returns to Ephesus and finds certain disciples who have not heard of the Holy Ghost. They are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and when Paul lays hands on them, they speak with tongues and prophesy. He reasons in the synagogue, then in the school of Tyrannus. God works special miracles by Paul. Certain Jewish exorcists attempt to use the name of Jesus, but the evil spirit overcomes them. Many confess and burn their magic books.

Demetrius, a silversmith who makes shrines for Diana, stirs up a riot, saying Paul persuades many that gods made with hands are not gods. The city is filled with confusion, and they shout for hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." The town clerk quiets the crowd and dismisses the assembly.

## Acts 20: Paul's Farewell to the Ephesian Elders

Paul travels through Macedonia and Greece and returns through Macedonia to Troas. On the first day of the week, the disciples gather to break bread, and Paul preaches until midnight. Eutychus falls from a third loft and is taken up dead. Paul embraces him, and he is brought alive. Paul continues speaking and then departs.

At Miletus, Paul calls the elders of Ephesus and reminds them how he serves with humility and warns that grievous wolves will enter among them. He says they will see his face no more and commends them to God. They weep and accompany him to the ship.

## Acts 21: Paul's Arrival in Jerusalem

Paul travels to Jerusalem despite warnings. In Caesarea, Agabus binds his own hands and feet with Paul's girdle and says the Jews will bind the owner and deliver him to the Gentiles. Paul says he is ready to die for the name of the Lord Jesus. In Jerusalem, he meets James and the elders and agrees to purify himself in the temple to show he walks orderly.

Jews from Asia stir up the crowd, accusing Paul of bringing Greeks into the temple. They seize him, and the city is in an uproar. The chief captain rescues him and allows him to speak to the people. Paul addresses them in Hebrew.

## Acts 22: Paul's Defense Before the People

Paul recounts his upbringing, his persecution of the followers of Jesus, and his journey to Damascus where he sees a light and hears the voice of Jesus. He tells how Ananias restores his sight and how he is told he will bear God's name before Gentiles. When he says he is sent to the Gentiles, the crowd cries out against him.

The chief captain orders him examined by scourging, but Paul asks if it is lawful to scourge a Roman uncondemned. When they learn he is a Roman citizen, they fear and refrain. The chief captain brings him before the council.

## Acts 23: The Plot Against Paul

Paul stands before the council and says he has lived in good conscience. The high priest Ananias commands him struck. Paul calls him a whited wall, then apologizes when told he is the high priest. Knowing part are Sadducees and part Pharisees, Paul cries out about the hope and resurrection of the dead. A dispute arises, and the chief captain rescues him.

That night the Lord stands by Paul and says he must also bear witness at Rome. More than forty Jews bind themselves with an oath to kill him. Paul's sister's son hears of the plot and informs the chief captain, who sends Paul by night with soldiers to Caesarea to Felix the governor.

## Acts 24: Paul Before Felix

Tertullus accuses Paul before Felix, calling him a pest and a mover of sedition. Paul answers that he worships the God of his fathers and believes all things written in the law and prophets. He says he comes to bring alms and offerings and denies stirring up a crowd. Felix delays judgment, having more perfect knowledge of that way, and keeps Paul in custody but allows him some liberty.

Felix and his wife Drusilla hear Paul speak about righteousness, temperance, and judgment. Felix trembles and sends him away, hoping for money. After two years, Porcius Festus succeeds Felix, and Felix leaves Paul bound to please the Jews.

## Acts 25: Paul Appeals to Caesar

Festus goes to Jerusalem, and the chief priests request Paul be brought there, planning to kill him on the way. Festus refuses and has Paul brought before him in Caesarea. The Jews lay many complaints that they cannot prove. Paul appeals to Caesar. Festus confers with the council and says he will go to Caesar.

King Agrippa and Bernice come to Caesarea. Festus explains Paul's case and says he has nothing certain to write to Caesar. He brings Paul before Agrippa.

## Acts 26: Paul Before Agrippa

Paul stretches forth his hand and speaks before Agrippa. He recounts his life as a Pharisee and his persecution of believers. He describes the light from heaven on the road to Damascus and the voice of Jesus telling him he is sent to open eyes and turn people from darkness to light. He says he preaches that they should repent and turn to God.

Festus says Paul is beside himself; Paul replies that he speaks words of truth. He asks Agrippa if he believes the prophets. Agrippa says Paul almost persuades him to be a Christian. Agrippa says Paul might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.

## Acts 27–28: The Voyage to Rome

Paul is delivered to Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band, to sail to Italy. The voyage is difficult, and Paul warns that there will be loss. A violent storm arises, and they are driven for many days. An angel tells Paul that no life will be lost, only the ship. The ship runs aground, and all two hundred seventy-six persons escape safely to land on Melita.

On Melita, a viper fastens on Paul's hand, but he shakes it off and suffers no harm. He heals the father of Publius and others. After three months, they sail to Rome. Paul is allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier. He calls the chief of the Jews and explains why he is bound. Some believe; others do not. He declares that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles. Paul dwells two whole years in his own hired house, receiving all who come to him and preaching the kingdom of God with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
