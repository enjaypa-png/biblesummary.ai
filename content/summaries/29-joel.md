## Joel 1: The Locust Plague and Call to Mourning

Joel delivers the word of the LORD and calls the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to listen. He asks whether such a disaster has ever happened and commands them to tell it to future generations. He describes successive waves of locusts that strip the land bare until nothing remains. Vineyards and fig trees are ruined, and the bark is stripped from the trees.

Joel tells the drunkards to wake up and weep because the new wine is cut off. He describes a powerful nation coming against the land, strong and without number, devouring everything like a lion. The grain, wine, and oil fail, and the fields are wasted. Farmers are ashamed, and joy dries up among the people.

Joel calls the priests to put on sackcloth and mourn because the offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD. He commands them to sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders, and cry out to the LORD. He announces that the day of the LORD is near and describes it as destruction from the Almighty. Crops fail, storehouses lie empty, animals groan for lack of pasture, and even the beasts cry to the LORD as fire consumes the land.

## Joel 2: The Day of the LORD and the Promise of the Spirit

Joel commands that a trumpet be blown in Zion because the day of the LORD is near. He describes it as a day of darkness and gloom. A great and powerful army spreads over the land. Before them the land is like Eden, but behind them it is a desolate wilderness. They run like horsemen, climb walls, and enter houses without breaking ranks. The earth quakes, the heavens tremble, and the sun and moon grow dark. Joel declares that the LORD gives His voice before His army, and the day of the LORD is great and very terrible.

The LORD calls the people to return to Him with all their heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning. He commands them to rend their hearts and not their garments. The priests are to weep between the porch and the altar and ask the LORD to spare His people and not make them a reproach.

The LORD responds with pity for His land and His people. He promises to send grain, wine, and oil and to remove the northern army far away. He tells the land and the people not to fear but to rejoice because He will do great things. He promises rain, restored harvests, and that He will repay the years the locusts have eaten. The people will eat in plenty and praise the LORD, and they will know He is in the midst of Israel.

The LORD then declares that He will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. Sons and daughters will prophesy, old men will dream dreams, and young men will see visions. He will show wonders in heaven and earth, and the sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and terrible day of the LORD. Whoever calls on the name of the LORD will be delivered in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem.

## Joel 3: Judgment of the Nations and Blessing for Zion

The LORD declares that when He restores Judah and Jerusalem, He will gather all nations into the valley of Jehoshaphat to judge them for scattering Israel and dividing the land. He describes how they cast lots for His people and sold them. He addresses Tyre, Zidon, and the coasts of Palestine and says He will return their actions upon their own heads.

He says the nations have taken His silver and gold and sold the children of Judah to the Greeks. He promises to bring His people back and to repay the nations. He calls the nations to prepare for war and gather in the valley where He will judge them. Multitudes stand in the valley of decision, for the day of the LORD is near.

The sun and moon grow dark, and the LORD roars from Zion, shaking heaven and earth. He declares that He is the hope and strength of Israel and that He dwells in Zion. Jerusalem will be holy, and strangers will no longer pass through her. The mountains will drip with new wine, hills will flow with milk, and waters will flow from the house of the LORD. Egypt and Edom will become desolate, but Judah and Jerusalem will dwell forever, for the LORD dwells in Zion.
