# Jeremiah

## Jeremiah 1: The Call of Jeremiah

The words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, a priest from Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, are recorded. The word of the LORD comes to him in the thirteenth year of King Josiah's reign over Judah. It continues to come to him through the reign of King Jehoiakim and until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah, when Jerusalem is carried into captivity. The LORD states that before He formed Jeremiah in the womb, He knew him and ordained him as a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah responds that he cannot speak because he is a child. The LORD commands him not to say he is a child, for he will go where the LORD sends him and speak what the LORD commands.

The LORD promises to be with Jeremiah to deliver him and tells him not to be afraid of the people's faces. Then, the LORD touches Jeremiah's mouth and puts His words in it. He sets Jeremiah over nations and kingdoms to root out, pull down, destroy, throw down, build, and plant. The LORD shows Jeremiah a vision of a rod from an almond tree, signifying that He will hasten His word to perform it. In a second vision, Jeremiah sees a seething pot with its face toward the north, and the LORD explains that evil will break forth from the north upon all the inhabitants of the land. The LORD declares He will call the families of the kingdoms of the north to set their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem. He will utter His judgments against His people for their wickedness, for forsaking Him, burning incense to other gods, and worshipping the works of their own hands. The LORD commands Jeremiah to arise and speak all that He commands, making him a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, its kings, priests, and people, who will fight against him but not prevail, for the LORD is with him to deliver him.

## Jeremiah 2: Israel's Faithlessness

The word of the LORD comes to Jeremiah, telling him to cry in the ears of Jerusalem. The LORD says He remembers the kindness of Israel's youth and their love when they followed Him in the wilderness. Israel was holiness to the LORD, the firstfruits of His increase, and all who devoured him would be held guilty. The LORD asks the house of Jacob what iniquity their fathers found in Him that they have gone far from Him, walking after vanity. They did not ask, "Where is the LORD who brought us out of Egypt?" The LORD brought them into a plentiful country, but they defiled His land and made His heritage an abomination. The priests did not ask where the LORD was, those who handle the law did not know Him, the pastors transgressed against Him, and the prophets prophesied by Baal.

The LORD declares His people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Him, the fountain of living waters, and have hewn out for themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Though they were planted as a noble vine, they have turned into a degenerate plant. Their iniquity is marked before Him. The house of Israel is ashamed, along with their kings, princes, priests, and prophets, who say to a stock, "You are my father," and to a stone, "You have brought me forth." The LORD will plead with them because they say they have not sinned, and they will be ashamed of Egypt as they were of Assyria, for the LORD has rejected their confidences, and they will not prosper in them.

## Jeremiah 3: Return, O Backsliding Israel

The LORD speaks of Judah playing the harlot with many lovers yet being allowed to return to Him. He contrasts backsliding Israel with treacherous Judah and says Israel has justified herself more than Judah. The LORD calls for the backsliding children to return, for He is married to them. He promises to take them one from a city and two from a family and bring them to Zion. He will give them pastors according to His own heart, who will feed them with knowledge and understanding. In those days, Jerusalem will be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations will be gathered to it. The house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north. The LORD calls for them to return, and He will heal their backslidings.

## Jeremiah 4: Judgment From the North

The LORD declares that if Israel will return, they should return to Him and put away their abominations. He commands them to circumcise their hearts, lest His fury comes forth like a fire that cannot be quenched. A command is given to blow the trumpet and assemble to go into the fortified cities. The LORD will bring evil from the north and a great destruction. A lion, the destroyer of the Gentiles, is on his way to make the land desolate. Jeremiah cries out in pain, beholding the earth without form and void, the heavens with no light, and the cities broken down. The LORD says the whole land will be desolate, yet He will not make a full end.

## Jeremiah 5: No One Seeks the Truth

The LORD commands to run through the streets of Jerusalem to see if there is one man who executes judgment and seeks the truth. Though the people say, "The LORD lives," they swear falsely. Jeremiah finds that both the poor and the great men have altogether broken the yoke. A lion, wolf, and leopard will come against them. The LORD asks how He can pardon them, for their children have forsaken Him and sworn by those that are no gods. When He fed them to the full, they committed adultery. He will bring a mighty and ancient nation from far against the house of Israel. The LORD calls them a foolish people without understanding, who have eyes but do not see, and ears but do not hear.

## Jeremiah 6: Prepare for Siege

The children of Benjamin are commanded to flee from Jerusalem. Evil appears out of the north with great destruction. The LORD has likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman. Shepherds with their flocks will come and pitch their tents against her. Jerusalem is warned to be instructed, lest the LORD's soul departs from her. From the least to the greatest, everyone is given to covetousness. They have healed the hurt of the daughter of His people slightly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace. The LORD told them to stand in the ways and ask for the old paths, the good way, but they said they would not. Therefore, He is bringing evil upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts.

## Jeremiah 7: The Temple Sermon

The word of the LORD comes to Jeremiah, commanding him to stand in the gate of the LORD's house and proclaim a message. The LORD warns them not to trust in lying words, saying, "The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these." If they thoroughly amend their ways and execute judgment, then He will cause them to dwell in the land. But they trust in lying words. They steal, murder, commit adultery, and burn incense to Baal, then come and stand before Him in His house. The LORD asks if His house has become a den of robbers. He will do to the house called by His name as He did to Shiloh. He commands Jeremiah not to pray for this people, for He will not hear. They provoke Him with cakes for the queen of heaven. Therefore, His anger and fury will be poured out. He did not command burnt offerings or sacrifices when He brought them out of Egypt, but obedience. They have built the high places of Tophet to burn their sons and daughters. The days are coming when it will be called the valley of slaughter.

## Jeremiah 8: No One Repents

At that time, the bones of the kings, princes, priests, prophets, and inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves and spread before the sun, moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have worshipped. These bones will not be gathered or buried. The LORD's people do not know the judgment of the LORD. They say, "We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us," but the pen of the scribes has written it in vain. They have healed the hurt slightly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace. The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and they are not saved. Jeremiah asks if there is no balm in Gilead and no physician there.

## Jeremiah 9: Lament Over Judah

Jeremiah expresses his deep sorrow, wishing his head were waters and his eyes a fountain of tears. He wishes to leave his people, for they are all adulterers and an assembly of treacherous men. They bend their tongues like a bow for lies. Everyone is warned not to trust any brother or neighbor. The LORD will melt them and try them. He will make Jerusalem heaps and the cities of Judah desolate. The LORD says not to let the wise man glory in his wisdom, the mighty man in his might, or the rich man in his riches, but let him who glories, glory in this, that he understands and knows the LORD. The days are coming when the LORD will punish all who are circumcised with the uncircumcised—Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab—for all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

## Jeremiah 10: Idols Versus the Living God

The LORD speaks to the house of Israel, telling them not to learn the way of the heathen. A tree is cut from the forest and decorated with silver and gold. These idols cannot speak and must be carried. There is none like the LORD, who is great, and His name is great in might. The LORD is the true God, the living God, and an everlasting king. He has made the earth by His power and established the world by His wisdom. The Portion of Jacob is not like them, for He is the former of all things. The noise of a great commotion is coming out of the north country. Jeremiah acknowledges that the way of man is not in himself. He asks the LORD to correct him with judgment, not in His anger.

## Jeremiah 11: The Broken Covenant

The word of the LORD comes to Jeremiah, telling him to hear the words of the covenant and speak them to the men of Judah and Jerusalem. The LORD says, "Cursed be the man that does not obey the words of this covenant." He commanded them when He brought them out of Egypt. Yet they did not obey. Therefore, He will bring upon them all the words of this covenant. A conspiracy is found among them. They have gone after other gods. The LORD will not hearken when they cry. The LORD had called her "A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit," but He has kindled fire upon it. The men of Anathoth seek Jeremiah's life. The LORD will punish them: the young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine.

## Jeremiah 12: Jeremiah's Complaint and the LORD's Answer

Jeremiah pleads with the LORD, asking why the way of the wicked prospers. He asks the LORD to pull out the wicked like sheep for the slaughter. The LORD responds: if Jeremiah has run with the footmen and they have wearied him, how can he contend with horses? Even his own brothers and his father's house have dealt treacherously with him. The LORD has forsaken His house and given His heritage into the hand of her enemies. Many pastors have destroyed His vineyard. The LORD will pluck out His evil neighbors who touch His inheritance. After He has plucked them out, He will return and have compassion and bring them again to their land. If they will diligently learn the ways of His people, they will be built in the midst of His people.

## Jeremiah 13: The Linen Girdle and the Broken Bottles

The LORD instructs Jeremiah to get a linen girdle, put it on, go to the Euphrates, and hide it. After many days, he retrieves it and finds it marred and profitable for nothing. The LORD will mar the pride of Judah and Jerusalem in the same way. They will be like this girdle. The LORD tells Jeremiah to speak of every bottle being filled with wine. He will fill the inhabitants with drunkenness and dash them one against another. The people are commanded to give glory to the LORD before He causes darkness. Jeremiah weeps because the LORD's flock is carried away captive. Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then may they also do good who are accustomed to do evil. The LORD will scatter them as stubble. He will discover their skirts upon their face.

## Jeremiah 14: The Drought and False Prophets

The word of the LORD comes to Jeremiah concerning the drought. Judah mourns. The nobles send their little ones for water but find none. Jeremiah prays for the people, acknowledging their iniquities. The LORD says He will not accept them. He tells Jeremiah not to pray for this people. The prophets prophesy lies in His name; He did not send them. They say, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace. The people to whom they prophesy will be cast out. Jeremiah's eyes run down with tears. The people ask if the LORD has utterly rejected Judah. They acknowledge their wickedness and plead with Him to remember His covenant. They will wait for Him.

## Jeremiah 15: No Intercession; Jeremiah's Lament

The LORD says that even if Moses and Samuel stood before Him, His mind could not be toward this people. He will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers. He will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh. He will fan them with a fan and destroy them. Jeremiah laments, "Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife!" The LORD says it will be well with Jeremiah's remnant. He will give their substance to the spoil. Jeremiah prays, asking the LORD to remember him and take revenge on his persecutors. He ate the LORD's words, and they were the joy of his heart. The LORD responds that if Jeremiah returns, He will bring him again to stand before Him. He will make him a fortified bronze wall; they will fight against him but not prevail.

## Jeremiah 16: Jeremiah Forbidden to Marry

The word of the LORD comes to Jeremiah, telling him not to take a wife or have sons or daughters. The sons and daughters born in this land will die grievous deaths. They will not be lamented or buried. Jeremiah is forbidden from entering the house of mourning or the house of feasting. The LORD will cause the voice of mirth and gladness to cease. When the people ask why, Jeremiah is to tell them it is because their fathers have forsaken the LORD and they have done worse. Therefore, He will cast them out into a land they do not know. The days are coming when it will be said, "The LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north." He will send for fishers and hunters. Jeremiah calls the LORD his strength, fortress, and refuge. The LORD will cause them to know His hand and His might.

## Jeremiah 17: Cursed and Blessed; The Sabbath

The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron on the table of their heart. The LORD says, "Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm." He will be like the heath in the desert. "Blessed is the man that trusts in the LORD." He will be like a tree planted by the waters. The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. The LORD searches the heart. The LORD is the hope of Israel. Jeremiah prays for healing. The LORD instructs Jeremiah to tell the people to hallow the sabbath day. If they do not carry a burden on the sabbath, the city will remain forever. If they will not hearken, He will kindle a fire in the gates of Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 18: The Potter's House

The word of the LORD comes to Jeremiah, telling him to go down to the potter's house. He sees the potter make a vessel of clay, and when it is marred, he makes it into another vessel. The LORD asks if He cannot do with the house of Israel as the potter does. As the clay is in the potter's hand, so is Israel in His hand. At any instant, He may speak concerning a nation to pluck it up or to build and plant it. If a nation turns from its evil, He will repent. The LORD is framing evil against them. But they say there is no hope. The people devise devices against Jeremiah. Jeremiah prays for the LORD to deliver him and to let his persecutors be overthrown.

## Jeremiah 19: The Broken Bottle

The LORD commands Jeremiah to get a potter's earthen bottle and take elders and priests to the valley of the son of Hinnom. He is to proclaim that the LORD will bring such evil upon this place that whoever hears it, his ears will tingle. They have forsaken the LORD and filled the place with the blood of innocents. They have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons. Therefore, the place will be called The valley of slaughter. The LORD will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem. Jeremiah is to break the bottle and say the LORD will break this people as one breaks a potter's vessel. Then Jeremiah stands in the court of the LORD's house and declares all these things to the people.

## Jeremiah 20: Pashur and Jeremiah's Lament

Pashur the priest hears Jeremiah prophesying and strikes him and puts him in the stocks. The next day, Jeremiah tells him the LORD has called his name Magor-missabib, "terror on every side." The LORD will make him a terror. All Judah will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon. Pashur and all who dwell in his house will go into captivity. Jeremiah laments that the LORD has deceived him and he is in derision daily. He had resolved not to speak in the LORD's name, but His word was in his heart like a burning fire. The LORD is with him as a mighty, terrible one. Jeremiah curses the day he was born and the man who brought the news to his father. He questions why he came forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow.
