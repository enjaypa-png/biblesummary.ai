# Hosea

## Hosea 1: Hosea Takes Gomer

The word of the LORD comes to Hosea and commands him to take a wife of whoredoms because the land has committed great whoredom against the LORD. Hosea takes Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she bears a son. The LORD tells him to name the child Jezreel, declaring that He will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu and cause the kingdom of Israel to cease. He says He will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

Gomer bears a daughter, and the LORD tells Hosea to name her Lo-ruhamah, saying He will no more have mercy upon Israel, though He will have mercy upon Judah. Afterward she bears a son, and he is named Lo-ammi, because Israel is not His people. Yet the LORD declares that the children of Israel will one day be as the sand of the sea and will again be called the sons of the living God. He says Judah and Israel will be gathered together under one head, and great will be the day of Jezreel.

## Hosea 2: Israel as Unfaithful Wife

The LORD speaks against Israel as an unfaithful wife and calls the children to plead with their mother. He warns that He will strip her bare and make her like a wilderness if she does not put away her whoredoms. She claims her lovers provide her food and clothing, not recognizing that the LORD gives her corn, wine, oil, silver, and gold. Therefore He says He will take these away and expose her lewdness before her lovers.

He declares He will cause her feasts to cease and destroy her vines and fig trees. Yet He also says He will allure her, bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her. He promises a covenant of peace, betrothal in righteousness and mercy, and renewed blessing in the land. He says He will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah and say to Lo-ammi, "Thou art my people," and they will answer, "Thou art my God."

## Hosea 3: Hosea Redeems His Wife

The LORD tells Hosea to love a woman beloved of another, reflecting the LORD's love toward Israel though they turn to other gods. Hosea buys her and tells her she must remain with him many days and not commit whoredom. He promises to be for her as well.

The chapter declares that Israel will remain many days without king, prince, sacrifice, image, ephod, or teraphim. Afterward they will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will fear the LORD and His goodness in the latter days.

## Hosea 4: No Truth, Mercy, or Knowledge

The LORD brings a controversy against the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth, mercy, or knowledge of God. Swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and adultery fill the land. The people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, and the priests are rejected because they reject knowledge and forget the law of God.

Ephraim is joined to idols, sacrificing upon mountains and under trees. The LORD says He will punish their ways, and their daughters and spouses commit whoredom. Judah is warned not to follow Israel's example. The chapter ends with Israel bound up in shame because of their sacrifices.

## Hosea 5: Judgment on Priests and Rulers

Priests, the house of Israel, and the king's house are called to hear judgment. Ephraim's whoredom and Israel's defilement are exposed, and their pride testifies against them. They attempt to seek the LORD with flocks and herds, but He withdraws from them because they deal treacherously.

The LORD says Ephraim goes to Assyria for help, but the king there cannot heal him. He declares He will be like a lion, tearing and going away until they acknowledge their offense and seek His face. In their affliction, they will seek Him early.

## Hosea 6: Mercy, Not Sacrifice

The people speak of returning to the LORD, saying He will heal and revive them. They describe His coming as certain as the morning and like rain upon the earth. Their words express a desire to know the LORD.

The LORD answers that their goodness is like a morning cloud that quickly vanishes. He says He desires mercy and the knowledge of God more than sacrifice. They transgress the covenant and commit violence and murder, even among priests. Israel is defiled, and a harvest of judgment is appointed.

## Hosea 7: Ephraim's Deceit and Weakness

When the LORD would heal Israel, iniquity is revealed. The people practice deceit, and their wickedness surrounds them though they do not consider that the LORD remembers all their actions. Their rulers fall, and none calls upon the LORD.

Ephraim is like a cake not turned, weakened and unaware. He calls to Egypt and goes to Assyria, but the LORD says He will spread His net over them. They howl upon their beds but do not cry to Him with their heart. They return, but not to the Most High, and their princes fall by the sword.

## Hosea 8: Transgressing the Covenant

A trumpet sounds because Israel has transgressed the covenant. They set up kings without the LORD and make idols of silver and gold. The calf of Samaria will be broken in pieces, and they sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.

Israel goes up to Assyria and multiplies altars to sin. Though the LORD writes His law to them, they treat it as a strange thing. He says He will remember their iniquity, and they will return to Egypt. Fire will devour their cities.

## Hosea 9: Israel Will Not Remain

Israel is told not to rejoice, for they have gone a whoring from their God. They will not remain in the LORD's land but will eat unclean things in Assyria. Their sacrifices will not please the LORD, and their feast days will bring no joy.

The days of visitation have come, and Israel will know it. Ephraim's glory will fly away, and even their children will not remain. The LORD says He hates their wickedness and will cast them out of His house. They will be wanderers among the nations.

## Hosea 10: The Vine and Divided Heart

Israel is described as a vine that brings fruit to himself and multiplies altars. Their heart is divided, and the LORD will break down their altars. Samaria's king will be cut off, and the high places will be destroyed.

The people are called to sow righteousness and seek the LORD, yet they trust in their own strength. Because of their wickedness, tumult and destruction will come, and their king will be cut off in a morning.

## Hosea 11: The LORD's Love for Israel

The LORD recalls loving Israel as a child and calling him out of Egypt. Though He teaches and cares for them, they sacrifice to Baalim. Because they refuse to return, Assyria will rule over them.

Yet the LORD speaks with compassion, asking how He can give Ephraim up. He declares He will not execute the fierceness of His anger because He is God and not man. He says they will walk after the LORD, and He will place them in their houses again.

## Hosea 12: Ephraim Feeds on Wind

Ephraim feeds on wind and makes alliances with Assyria and Egypt. The LORD has a controversy with Jacob and recalls how Jacob struggled with the angel and sought God at Beth-el.

The LORD calls Israel to return and keep mercy and judgment. Ephraim acts as a deceitful merchant and boasts in riches. The LORD reminds them that He brought them out of Egypt by a prophet and says He will repay their bitter provocation.

## Hosea 13: Ephraim's Idolatry and Destruction

Ephraim once exalted himself but fell through Baal worship. They continue making idols and are compared to morning clouds and smoke that vanishes. The LORD declares He alone is their God and Savior.

Because they forget Him after being filled, He says He will be like a lion and a bear against them. Their king cannot save them. Samaria becomes desolate, and the chapter ends with severe judgment and destruction.

## Hosea 14: Return and Restoration

Hosea calls Israel to return to the LORD and confess their iniquity. They renounce trust in Asshur, horses, and idols, and seek mercy from God.

The LORD promises to heal their backsliding and love them freely. He compares Israel's renewal to dew, lilies, olive trees, and vines. Ephraim will turn from idols, and fruit will be found in the LORD. The book closes by declaring that the ways of the LORD are right, and the just walk in them, while transgressors fall.
