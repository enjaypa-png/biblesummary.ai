## Jonah 1: Jonah Flees from the Lord

The word of the Lord comes unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. But Jonah rises up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He goes down to Joppa, finds a ship going to Tarshish, pays the fare thereof, and goes down into it. The Lord sends out a great wind into the sea, and there is a mighty tempest, so that the ship is like to be broken. The mariners are afraid, and cry every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that are in the ship into the sea to lighten it. But Jonah is gone down into the sides of the ship, and he lies fast asleep.

The shipmaster comes to him and asks, What meanest thou, O sleeper? He urges Jonah to arise and call upon his God, if so be that God will think upon them, that they perish not. The mariners say every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. They cast lots, and the lot falls upon Jonah. They question him about his occupation, his country, and his people. He tells them he is an Hebrew and fears the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. The men are exceedingly afraid and ask why he has done this, for they know he fled from the presence of the Lord. They ask what they shall do unto him that the sea may be calm. Jonah tells them to take him up and cast him forth into the sea, for he knows that for his sake this great tempest is upon them. Nevertheless, the men row hard to bring the ship to land, but they cannot. Wherefore they cry unto the Lord, saying, We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood. So they take up Jonah and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceases from her raging. Then the men fear the Lord exceedingly, and offer a sacrifice and make vows. Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah is in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

## Jonah 2: Jonah's Prayer

Then Jonah prays unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly. He says he cried by reason of his affliction unto the Lord, and He heard him; out of the belly of hell he cried, and God heard his voice. He recounts how he was cast into the deep, in the midst of the seas, and the floods compassed him about. He said he was cast out of God's sight, yet he would look again toward His holy temple. The waters compassed him about, even to the soul; the depth closed him round about, and the weeds were wrapped about his head. He went down to the bottoms of the mountains, and the earth with her bars was about him for ever; yet, he says, God has brought up his life from corruption.

When his soul fainted within him, he remembered the Lord, and his prayer came in unto God, into His holy temple. He declares that they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. But he will sacrifice unto God with the voice of thanksgiving and will pay that which he has vowed. He concludes that salvation is of the Lord. And the Lord speaks unto the fish, and it vomits out Jonah upon the dry land.

## Jonah 3: Nineveh Repents

The word of the Lord comes unto Jonah the second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. So Jonah arises and goes unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh is an exceeding great city of three days' journey. Jonah begins to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cries, and says, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. The people of Nineveh believe God, and proclaim a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

For word comes unto the king of Nineveh, and he arises from his throne, lays his robe from him, covers himself with sackcloth, and sits in ashes. He causes it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, that neither man nor beast should taste any thing, but that they be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God. He commands every one to turn from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands, asking, Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? And God sees their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repents of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them, and he does it not.

## Jonah 4: Jonah's Anger

But it displeases Jonah exceedingly, and he is very angry. He prays unto the Lord and says this was his saying when he was yet in his country, which is why he fled before unto Tarshish. He says he knew that God is a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. Therefore, he asks the Lord to take his life from him, for it is better for him to die than to live. Then the Lord asks him, Doest thou well to be angry?

So Jonah goes out of the city and sits on the east side, and there makes him a booth and sits under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. The Lord God prepares a gourd and makes it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah is exceeding glad of the gourd. But God prepares a worm when the morning rises the next day, and it smites the gourd that it withers. And it comes to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die. God asks Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he says, I do well to be angry, even unto death. Then the Lord says that Jonah has had pity on the gourd, for which he has not laboured, but which came up in a night and perished in a night. And, the Lord asks, should not He spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?
