# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1: Thanksgiving and Judgment at Christ's Coming

Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus greet the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. They speak of their growing faith and love and boast of their patience during persecutions. They say God repays trouble to those who trouble them and gives rest when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, taking vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel. These face everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord when he comes to be glorified in his saints. Paul prays that God counts them worthy of this calling and fulfills every work of faith with power so that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is glorified in them.

## 2 Thessalonians 2: The Man of Sin and the Day of the Lord

Paul urges the brothers not to be shaken by claims that the day of Christ is already present. He says that day does not come unless there is first a falling away and the man of sin, the son of perdition, is revealed, exalting himself above all that is called God and sitting in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. He reminds them that he told them these things before. He says the mystery of iniquity already works, but something restrains until the Wicked is revealed, whom the Lord destroys with the brightness of his coming. This comes with the working of Satan, with power and lying wonders among those who do not receive the love of the truth. Paul gives thanks that God calls them through the gospel and tells them to stand fast and hold the traditions they are taught.

## 2 Thessalonians 3: Prayer, Work, and Discipline

Paul asks for prayer that the word of the Lord runs swiftly and that he is delivered from wicked men. He says the Lord is faithful to establish and keep them from evil and asks that their hearts be directed into the love of God and patient waiting for Christ. He commands them to withdraw from any brother who walks disorderly and reminds them that he worked night and day, teaching that if any would not work, neither should he eat. He tells the idle to work quietly and eat their own bread. If anyone does not obey this letter, they are to avoid him so that he is ashamed, yet warn him as a brother. Paul closes with his greeting and a blessing of peace and grace.
