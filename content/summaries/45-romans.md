## Romans 1: Paul's Greeting and the Wrath of God Against Ungodliness

Paul introduces himself as a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and separated to preach the gospel of God. He says this gospel concerns God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who is made of the seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead. Paul explains that through Christ he receives grace and apostleship to bring about obedience of faith among all nations. He addresses the believers in Rome as those loved by God and called to be saints, and he gives thanks for their faith, which is spoken of throughout the whole world. He tells them he prays continually to visit them and longs to see them so he may share a spiritual gift and be comforted together with them by mutual faith.

Paul says he is ready to preach the gospel in Rome and declares he is not ashamed of it, because it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. He states that the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel from faith to faith. He then describes the wrath of God revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth. He says people know God through creation, yet they do not glorify him as God. Their thinking becomes empty, and their foolish heart is darkened. They exchange the glory of the incorruptible God for images of corruptible creatures. God gives them over to uncleanness, dishonorable passions, and a reprobate mind. They fill themselves with all manner of unrighteousness and continue in these things while approving others who do the same.

## Romans 2: God's Righteous Judgment

Paul addresses a person who judges others and says that anyone who judges commits the same kinds of sins. He warns that God's judgment is according to truth and that those who continue in evil will not escape. He explains that God will render to every man according to his deeds: eternal life to those who continue in well-doing, and indignation and wrath to those who obey unrighteousness. He says there is no respect of persons with God. Gentiles who sin without the law perish without the law, and Jews who sin under the law are judged by the law.

He explains that hearing the law does not justify a person; doing the law matters. Gentiles who do by nature what the law requires show the work of the law written in their hearts. He says God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. Turning to the Jew, he says that relying on the law and boasting in God does not excuse breaking the law. He warns that breaking the law dishonors God and causes his name to be blasphemed among the Gentiles. He says circumcision profits only if the law is kept, and true circumcision is inward, in the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter.

## Romans 3: All Under Sin, Justified by Faith

Paul asks what advantage the Jew has and answers that they are entrusted with the oracles of God. He says human unbelief does not cancel God's faithfulness. He insists that God is true though every man is a liar. He rejects the idea that human sin makes God unjust in judging the world. He concludes that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin. He quotes the Scriptures to show that none is righteous, none understands, and none seeks after God. Their throat, tongue, lips, and mouth reveal deceit and bitterness, and their feet are swift to shed blood. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

He explains that the law speaks to those under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God. By the deeds of the law no flesh is justified. He then describes the righteousness of God without the law, witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ to all who believe. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Justification comes freely by grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus, whom God sets forth as a propitiation through faith in his blood. God remains just while justifying the one who has faith in Jesus. Boasting is excluded, and a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

## Romans 4: Abraham Justified by Faith

Paul turns to Abraham and asks what he has found according to the flesh. He says Abraham believes God, and it is counted to him for righteousness. He explains that wages are not counted as grace but as debt, yet to the one who does not work but believes, faith is counted for righteousness. He refers to David, who speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works, whose sins are forgiven and covered.

Paul asks whether this blessedness is only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised. He explains that Abraham's faith is counted for righteousness before he is circumcised. Circumcision is a sign and seal of the righteousness he already has by faith. He says Abraham is the father of all who believe, whether circumcised or not. The promise that he should be heir of the world is not through the law but through the righteousness of faith. Abraham believes God's promise despite his own aged body and Sarah's womb being as good as dead. He is fully persuaded that what God promises, he is able to perform. This righteousness is written not for Abraham alone, but also for those who believe on him who raises up Jesus our Lord from the dead.

## Romans 5: Peace with God and Adam and Christ

Paul says that being justified by faith, believers have peace with God through Jesus Christ and access into grace. He says they rejoice in hope of the glory of God and also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces patience, experience, and hope. He explains that hope does not make ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost. Christ dies for the ungodly while they are still sinners. God demonstrates his love in this act, and through Christ's blood believers are saved from wrath and reconciled to God.

Paul compares Adam and Jesus Christ. Through one man sin enters the world, and death through sin, and death passes upon all men. He explains that death reigns from Adam to Moses. Adam is a figure of him who is to come. Yet the gift is not like the offense. Through one man's offense many die, but the grace of God and the gift by grace abound to many. By one man's disobedience many are made sinners; by one man's obedience many are made righteous. The law enters so that the offense might abound, but where sin abounds, grace much more abounds, so that grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ.

## Romans 6: Dead to Sin, Alive to God

Paul asks if people should continue in sin so that grace may abound and answers, "God forbid." He says those who are baptized into Jesus Christ are baptized into his death. They are buried with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ is raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, they also should walk in newness of life. He explains that the old man is crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed.

He urges believers to reckon themselves dead to sin but alive to God through Jesus Christ. Sin should not reign in their mortal body. They are not under the law but under grace. He explains that whoever a person yields himself to obey becomes that servant's servant, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness. Being made free from sin, they become servants of righteousness and now have fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life. He states that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 7: The Law and the Inner Struggle

Paul explains that the law has dominion over a person as long as he lives. He uses marriage as an example: a woman is bound to her husband while he lives, but if he dies she is free. He says believers become dead to the law by the body of Christ so they may belong to another, even to him who is raised from the dead. The law reveals sin; he would not have known lust except the law says, "Thou shalt not covet." Sin takes occasion by the commandment and produces all manner of desire.

He says the commandment is holy, just, and good, but sin uses it to bring death. He describes an inner struggle: what he wants to do he does not do, and what he hates he does. He finds a law that when he wants to do good, evil is present with him. He delights in the law of God after the inward man, but he sees another law in his members bringing him into captivity. He cries out, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" He thanks God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 8: Life in the Spirit and God's Love

Paul declares that there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ makes them free from the law of sin and death. What the law cannot do because it is weak through the flesh, God does by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh. Those who walk after the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. The Spirit dwells in them and gives life.

He says believers are sons of God, led by the Spirit, and they cry, "Abba, Father." They are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if they suffer with him. He speaks of creation groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. The Spirit helps in weakness and makes intercession. All things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to his purpose. Those whom he foreknows he predestinates, calls, justifies, and glorifies. He declares that nothing can separate believers from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 9: God's Sovereign Choice of Israel

Paul expresses great sorrow for Israel and says he could wish himself accursed for his brethren, the Israelites. He lists their privileges: adoption, glory, covenants, law, service, promises, and the fathers, and from them Christ comes according to the flesh. He explains that not all who are of Israel are Israel. He speaks of Isaac and Ishmael, and of Jacob and Esau, showing that God's purpose stands not by works but by him who calls.

He anticipates the question of unrighteousness with God and says, "God forbid." God says to Moses that he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy. He speaks of Pharaoh, whom God raises up to show his power. He compares God to a potter who has power over the clay. He quotes from Osee and Esaias to show that Gentiles obtain righteousness by faith, while Israel, seeking it by works of the law, does not attain it. They stumble at the stumblingstone.

## Romans 10: Righteousness by Faith and Israel's Disobedience

Paul says his heart's desire and prayer for Israel is that they might be saved. He says they have zeal for God but not according to knowledge, because they seek to establish their own righteousness rather than submit to the righteousness of God. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. He says that if a person confesses with the mouth the Lord Jesus and believes in the heart that God raises him from the dead, he is saved.

He explains that there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is rich to all who call upon him. "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." He asks how they shall call on him in whom they have not believed and how they shall believe without hearing. He quotes Esaias, who says, "Lord, who hath believed our report?" He says faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. He concludes that Israel hears but does not obey, as Esaias and Moses indicate.

## Romans 11: God's Mercy to Israel and the Olive Tree

Paul asks whether God casts away his people and answers that he does not. He points to himself as an Israelite of the seed of Abraham. He recalls Elias, who thinks he is alone, yet God tells him he has reserved seven thousand who do not bow to Baal. So there is a remnant according to the election of grace. Israel as a whole does not obtain what it seeks, but the elect obtain it.

He explains that through Israel's fall salvation comes to the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy. He uses the image of an olive tree: some branches are broken off, and Gentiles are grafted in. He warns Gentiles not to boast. He says blindness in part happens to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. He quotes Esaias that there shall come out of Sion the Deliverer. He concludes by praising God's unsearchable judgments and ways.

## Romans 12: Living Sacrifice and Love

Paul urges believers by the mercies of God to present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, and not to be conformed to this world but transformed by the renewing of their mind. He tells them not to think of themselves more highly than they ought but to think soberly. He describes the body with many members and different gifts such as prophecy, ministry, teaching, exhortation, giving, ruling, and showing mercy.

He commands that love be without hypocrisy. They should hate evil and cling to good, be kindly affectionate, patient in tribulation, and continuing in prayer. They are to bless those who persecute them and not repay evil for evil. If possible, they should live peaceably with all men. They are not to avenge themselves but leave room for wrath, for vengeance belongs to the Lord.

## Romans 13: Subjection to Authorities and Love

Paul instructs every soul to be subject to higher powers because there is no power but of God. Rulers are ministers of God to execute wrath upon those who do evil. Therefore, people should be subject not only for wrath but for conscience' sake. He says to pay tribute, custom, fear, and honor to whom they are due.

He sums up commandments in the word, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." Love works no ill to his neighbor. He says the night is far spent and the day is at hand. Believers are to cast off works of darkness and put on the armor of light. They are to put on the Lord Jesus Christ and not make provision for the flesh.

## Romans 14: Liberty and Consideration for the Weak

Paul addresses disputes about doubtful matters. He tells believers to receive one who is weak in the faith but not to argue over opinions. One eats all things, another eats herbs. One esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Each person is to be fully persuaded in his own mind. No one lives or dies to himself; whether living or dying, they belong to the Lord.

He warns not to judge one another, for all will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. He urges them not to put a stumblingblock in a brother's way. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. He says it is good not to eat or drink anything that causes a brother to stumble.

## Romans 15: Bearing with the Weak and Paul's Plans

Paul urges the strong to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please themselves. Christ does not please himself but bears reproach. He says the Scriptures are written for learning and hope. He quotes passages showing that Jesus Christ becomes a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God and that Gentiles glorify God for his mercy.

Paul describes his ministry among the Gentiles and says he strives to preach the gospel where Christ is not named. He plans to visit Rome on his way to Spain but first goes to Jerusalem to minister to the saints, bringing contributions from Macedonia and Achaia. He asks for prayers that he may be delivered from unbelievers in Judaea and come to them with joy.

## Romans 16: Greetings and Warnings

Paul commends Phebe, a servant of the church at Cenchrea, asking that she be received in the Lord. He greets Priscilla and Aquila, his helpers in Christ Jesus, and many others by name, including Epaenetus, Mary, Andronicus, Junia, Amplias, Urbane, Stachys, Apelles, and several households. He instructs them to greet one another with a holy kiss.

He warns them to mark those who cause divisions contrary to the doctrine they have learned and avoid them. He says such people serve their own belly and deceive hearts with good words. He assures them that the God of peace will bruise Satan under their feet shortly. He closes with greetings from Timotheus, Lucius, Jason, Sosipater, Tertius who writes the epistle, and others. He ends with praise to God, who is able to establish them according to the gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ.
