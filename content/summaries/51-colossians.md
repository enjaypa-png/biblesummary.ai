## Colossians 1: Thanksgiving, Prayer, and the Preeminence of Christ

Paul and Timotheus greet the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colosse and speak of grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul gives thanks for their faith in Christ Jesus and their love for all saints, which grow from the hope laid up in heaven. He says they learn the truth of the gospel from Epaphras, a faithful minister of Christ, who declares their love in the Spirit. Paul prays that they are filled with the knowledge of God's will, walk worthy of the Lord, bear fruit in every good work, grow in the knowledge of God, and are strengthened with patience and joy. He says God delivers them from the power of darkness and brings them into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom they have redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins.

He describes Jesus Christ as the image of the invisible God and the firstborn of every creature. All things in heaven and earth, visible and invisible, including thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, are created by him and for him. He is before all things, and by him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church, and the firstborn from the dead. Paul says it pleases the Father that all fullness dwells in him and that through him God reconciles all things by the blood of his cross. Paul speaks of his ministry and the mystery once hidden but now revealed: Christ in you, the hope of glory.

## Colossians 2: Complete in Christ, Beware of False Philosophy

Paul says he has great conflict for the believers at Colosse and Laodicea and desires that their hearts are comforted and joined together in love. He says in Christ are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge and warns them not to be beguiled with enticing words. He urges them to continue walking in Christ, rooted and built up in him. He warns them to beware of philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men and the principles of the world, and not after Christ. He says all fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ, and they are complete in him.

He speaks of spiritual circumcision made without hands, burial with Christ in baptism, and being raised through faith. He says God forgives their trespasses and blots out the handwriting of ordinances, nailing it to the cross. Christ spoils principalities and powers openly. Paul tells them not to let anyone judge them in food, drink, holy days, new moons, or sabbath days, or beguile them in humility and worshipping of angels. He says these things have a show of wisdom but are not of true value against the flesh.

## Colossians 3: Seek Things Above and Put On the New Man

He tells them that if they are risen with Christ, they are to seek things above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God. They are to set their affection on things above, not on the earth, because their life is hidden with Christ in God. He commands them to put to death fornication, uncleanness, evil desire, and covetousness. He says they once walk in these things but are now to put off anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech, and lying, since they put off the old man and put on the new.

He says there is neither Greek nor Jew, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all. He tells them to put on mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering, and forgiveness. Above all, they are to put on charity. He instructs wives to submit to their husbands, husbands to love their wives, children to obey parents, fathers not to provoke children, servants to obey masters in all things, and masters to give what is just and equal, knowing they also have a Master in heaven.

## Colossians 4: Prayer, Conduct, and Greetings

He tells them to continue in prayer and to pray that he speaks the mystery of Christ clearly. He urges them to walk in wisdom toward those outside and to let their speech be with grace. Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister, makes known Paul's affairs, along with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother.

Aristarchus greets them, along with Marcus, Jesus called Justus, Epaphras, Luke the beloved physician, and Demas. Paul greets the brethren in Laodicea and Nymphas and the church in his house. He instructs that the epistle be read also in Laodicea and tells Archippus to fulfill his ministry. Paul closes with his own greeting and asks them to remember his bonds, ending with grace.
