## Esther 1: King Ahasuerus and Queen Vashti

In the third year of his reign, King Ahasuerus of Persia, who rules from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces, holds a grand feast in the palace at Shushan. For 180 days, he displays the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor of his majesty to all his nobles and officials. Afterward, he hosts a seven-day feast for all the people in Shushan, from the greatest to the least, in the enclosed garden of the king's palace. The setting is lavish, with white, green, and blue hangings, gold and silver couches, and a mosaic pavement. Royal wine is served in abundance in golden vessels.

On the seventh day, when the king is merry with wine, he commands his seven chamberlains to bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and the nobles. However, Queen Vashti refuses to come at the king's command. The king becomes furious, and his anger burns within him. He consults his wise men, who know the law and judgment. Memucan, one of the seven princes of Persia and Media, advises the king that Vashti has wronged not only the king but also all the nobles and people in the provinces. He warns that her disobedience will become known to all women, causing them to despise their husbands. Memucan proposes that the king issue a royal decree, to be written into the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Ahasuerus. Her royal position is to be given to someone else who is better than she. The king and his princes are pleased with this advice, and the king sends letters to all parts of his kingdom, declaring that every man should be ruler over his own household.

## Esther 2: Esther Becomes Queen

After King Ahasuerus's anger has subsided, his attendants suggest that a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king. They propose that officers be appointed in all the provinces to bring all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in the citadel of Shushan, under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the women. The young woman who pleases the king the most will become queen instead of Vashti. The king approves of this plan and puts it into effect. In the citadel of Shushan, there is a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai son of Jair, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. Mordecai has a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had no father or mother. She is also known as Esther, and she is lovely in form and features. When the king's order is proclaimed, Esther is taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai. She wins his favor and he provides her with beauty treatments, special food, and seven female attendants from the king's palace. At Mordecai's instruction, Esther does not reveal her nationality and family background. Mordecai walks back and forth near the courtyard of the harem every day to find out how she is and what is happening to her.

After twelve months of beauty treatments, the young women are taken to King Ahasuerus. Esther, the daughter of Abihail, Mordecai's uncle, asks for nothing other than what Hegai recommends. She wins the favor of everyone who sees her. When she is taken to the king in the seventh year of his reign, he is attracted to her more than to any of the other women, and he sets a royal crown on her head and makes her queen instead of Vashti. The king gives a great banquet, "Esther's banquet," for all his nobles and officials. During this time, while Mordecai is sitting at the king's gate, two of the king's officers who guard the doorway, Bigthan and Teresh, become angry and conspire to assassinate King Ahasuerus. Mordecai finds out about the plot and tells Queen Esther, who reports it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai. The report is investigated and found to be true, and the two officials are hanged on a gallows. All this is recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.

## Esther 3: Haman's Plot Against the Jews

King Ahasuerus honors Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles. All the royal officials at the king's gate kneel down and pay honor to Haman, as the king had commanded. Mordecai, however, does not kneel down or pay him honor. The royal officials at the king's gate ask Mordecai why he disobeys the king's command. When he pays no attention to them day after day, they tell Haman, hoping to see whether Mordecai's behavior will be tolerated, for he had told them he is a Jew.

When Haman sees that Mordecai will not kneel down or pay him honor, he is enraged. Yet he scorns the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead, Haman looks for a way to destroy all of Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. In the first month, the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast the *pur* (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. The lot falls on the twelfth month, the month of Adar. Haman then goes to King Ahasuerus and tells him that there is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of the kingdom whose laws are different from those of every other people and who do not obey the king's laws. He says it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them. Haman proposes that a decree be issued to destroy them, and he offers to pay ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury to carry out the plan. The king takes his signet ring from his finger and gives it to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. The king tells Haman that the money and the people are his to do with as he sees fit. The royal secretaries are summoned, and on the thirteenth day of the first month, the decree is written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring. Dispatches are sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. The couriers go out, spurred on by the king's command, and the edict is also issued in the citadel of Shushan. The king and Haman sit down to drink, but the city of Shushan is in confusion.

## Esther 4: Mordecai Persuades Esther to Help

When Mordecai learns of all that has been done, he tears his clothes, puts on sackcloth and ashes, and goes out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. He goes only as far as the king's gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth is allowed to enter it. In every province to which the edict and order of the king come, there is great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing. Many lie in sackcloth and ashes.

When Esther's eunuchs and female attendants come and tell her about Mordecai, she is in great distress. She sends clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he will not accept them. Then Esther summons Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and orders him to find out what is troubling Mordecai and why. Hathach goes out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate. Mordecai tells him everything that has happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. He also gives him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Shushan, to show to Esther and explain it to her. He tells him to urge her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people. Hathach goes back and reports to Esther what Mordecai had said. Esther then instructs Hathach to say to Mordecai that all the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned, there is but one law: that he be put to death. The only exception is for the one to whom the king extends the golden scepter, that he may live. And, she adds, she has not been summoned to see the king for thirty days. When Esther's words are reported to Mordecai, he sends back this answer: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" Then Esther sends this reply to Mordecai: "Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Shushan, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish." Mordecai then goes away and carries out all of Esther's instructions.

## Esther 5: Esther's First Banquet

On the third day of the fast, Esther puts on her royal robes and stands in the inner court of the king's palace, in front of the king's hall. The king is sitting on his royal throne, facing the entrance. When he sees Queen Esther standing in the court, he is pleased with her and holds out to her the golden scepter that is in his hand. So Esther approaches and touches the tip of the scepter. The king asks her what she wants, promising to give her up to half of the kingdom.

Esther replies that if it pleases the king, she would like the king and Haman to come that day to a banquet she has prepared for him. The king gives orders for Haman to be brought quickly, and they both go to the banquet. As they are drinking wine, the king again asks Esther what her petition is, and he promises to grant it. Esther answers that her petition and request is that if the king regards her with favor and is pleased to grant her petition, he and Haman should come to another banquet she will prepare for them the next day. Then she will answer the king's question. Haman goes out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he sees Mordecai at the king's gate and notices that he does not stand up or show fear in his presence, he is filled with rage. Nevertheless, Haman restrains himself and goes home. Calling together his friends and his wife, Zeresh, Haman boasts of his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king has honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials. He adds that he is the only person Queen Esther had invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave, and that he has been invited along with the king to another banquet the next day. But, he says, all this gives him no satisfaction as long as he sees that Jew, Mordecai, sitting at the king's gate. His wife Zeresh and all his friends advise him to have a gallows built, seventy-five feet high, and to ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then he can go to the banquet with the king without a care. The suggestion pleases Haman, and he has the gallows built.

## Esther 6: Mordecai Is Honored

That night, the king cannot sleep, so he orders the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him. It is found written that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. The king asks what honor and recognition Mordecai has received for this, and his attendants reply that nothing has been done for him.

The king then asks who is in the court. Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared. The king's servants announce that Haman is standing in the court, and the king says to bring him in. When Haman enters, the king asks him what should be done for the man the king delights to honor. Haman thinks to himself, "Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?" So he answers the king, suggesting that for the man the king delights to honor, a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head, should be brought. He proposes that the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes, who should then robe the man and lead him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!" The king then commands Haman to go at once and do just as he has suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate, and not to neglect any detail. So Haman takes the robe and the horse, robes Mordecai, and leads him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming the king's words. Afterward, Mordecai returns to the king's gate, but Haman rushes home, with his head covered in grief. He tells his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that has happened to him. His advisers and his wife say to him that since Mordecai, before whom his downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, he cannot stand against him—he will surely come to ruin. While they are still talking, the king's eunuchs arrive and hurry Haman away to the banquet Esther has prepared.

## Esther 7: Haman Is Hanged

So the king and Haman go to dine with Queen Esther. On the second day, as they are drinking wine, the king again asks Esther what her petition is, promising to give her up to half of the kingdom. Queen Esther answers that if she has found favor with the king and if it pleases him, her petition is that her life be spared, and her request is that her people be spared. She explains that she and her people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation. She adds that if they had merely been sold as male and female slaves, she would have kept quiet, because that would not have been a matter worthy of disturbing the king.

King Ahasuerus demands to know who is the man who has dared to do such a thing. Esther declares that the adversary and enemy is the vile Haman. Haman is terrified before the king and queen. The king gets up in a rage, leaves his wine, and goes out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king has already decided his fate, stays behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. Just as the king returns from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman is falling on the couch where Esther is reclining. The king exclaims, "Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?" As soon as the words leave the king's mouth, they cover Haman's face. Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, points out that a gallows seventy-five feet high stands by Haman's house, which he had made for Mordecai, who had spoken up to help the king. The king commands that Haman be hanged on it. So they hang Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsides.

## Esther 8: Mordecai's Decree

That same day, King Ahasuerus gives Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Mordecai comes before the king, for Esther had told him how he is related to her. The king takes off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and gives it to Mordecai. Esther appoints Mordecai over Haman's estate.

Esther again pleads with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begs him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. The king extends the golden scepter to Esther, and she rises and stands before him. She asks that if it pleases the king and if she has found favor in his sight, an order be written to revoke the dispatches that Haman had devised and written to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces. King Ahasuerus says to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew that he has given Haman's estate to Esther and that Haman has been hanged on the gallows because he stretched out his hand against the Jews. He then authorizes them to write another decree in the king's name in behalf of the Jews, as seems best to them, and to seal it with the king's signet ring, for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked. The royal secretaries are summoned, and Mordecai dictates a new decree. It is written in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed with his signet ring, and sent by mounted couriers to all 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia. The king's edict grants the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill, and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them and their women and children; and to plunder the property of their enemies. This is to take place on a single day throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. The couriers, pressed on by the king's command, ride out, and the edict is also issued in the citadel of Shushan. Mordecai goes out from the king's presence wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold, and a purple robe of fine linen. The city of Shushan holds a joyous celebration. For the Jews, it is a time of light and gladness, joy and honor. In every province and in every city, wherever the edict of the king comes, there is joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities become Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.

## Esther 9: The Jews Destroy Their Enemies

On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king is to be carried out. On this day, the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables are turned and the Jews have the upper hand over those who hate them. The Jews assemble in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to attack those who had sought their destruction. No one can stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities are afraid of them. All the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the king's administrators help the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them. Mordecai is now prominent in the palace; his reputation spreads throughout the provinces, and he becomes more and more powerful.

The Jews strike down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they do what they want to those who hate them. In the citadel of Shushan, the Jews kill and destroy five hundred men. They also kill the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews: Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. However, they do not lay a hand on the plunder. The number of those killed in the citadel of Shushan is reported to the king that same day. The king says to Queen Esther that the Jews have killed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Shushan. He asks what they have done in the rest of the royal provinces and what her petition is, promising it will be given to her. Esther replies that if it pleases the king, the Jews in Shushan should be allowed to carry out today's edict tomorrow also, and that the bodies of Haman's ten sons should be hanged on the gallows. The king commands that this be done. The Jews in Shushan assemble again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they kill three hundred men, but they do not lay a hand on the plunder. Meanwhile, the rest of the Jews in the king's provinces had assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They had killed seventy-five thousand of them but had not laid a hand on the plunder. This happens on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rest and make it a day of feasting and joy. The Jews of the villages, however, celebrate on the fourteenth day. Mordecai records these events and sends letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, near and far, to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies and their sorrow was turned into joy. They are to celebrate them as days of feasting and joy and of sending presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor. The Jews agree to continue the celebration they had begun, in accordance with Mordecai's letter. Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, writes with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim. The decree of Esther confirms these regulations about Purim, and it is written down in the records.

## Esther 10: The Greatness of Mordecai

King Ahasuerus imposes tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores. All his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia.

Mordecai the Jew is second in rank to King Ahasuerus, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews. He works for the good of his people and speaks up for the welfare of all the Jews.
