# Nehemiah

## Nehemiah 1: Nehemiah's Prayer

The book begins with the words of Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah. In the month of Chislev, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, Nehemiah is in the palace at Shushan when his brother Hanani and other men arrive from Judah. Nehemiah asks them about the Jewish remnant that has survived the exile and about the condition of Jerusalem. They report that the survivors in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.

Upon hearing this news, Nehemiah sits down, weeps, and mourns for several days. He fasts and prays to the God of heaven, addressing Him as the great and awesome God who keeps His covenant of love with those who love Him and obey His commands. He confesses the sins of the Israelites, including himself and his own family, acknowledging that they have acted corruptly and have not obeyed the commands, decrees, and laws given through Moses. He reminds God of His promise to scatter them if they are unfaithful but to gather them from the farthest lands if they return to Him and obey His commands. Nehemiah concludes his prayer by asking God to be attentive to his prayer and to grant him favor in the sight of the king, for he is the king's cupbearer.

## Nehemiah 2: Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem

In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is serving wine to the king. The king notices Nehemiah's sadness, as he had never appeared sad before. The king asks why he looks sad when he is not ill, concluding it must be a sadness of heart. Nehemiah is fearful but explains that he is sad because the city where his ancestors are buried lies in ruins with its gates destroyed by fire. The king asks what he wants, and after praying to the God of heaven, Nehemiah requests that the king send him to Judah to rebuild the city of his fathers.

The king, with the queen sitting beside him, agrees and asks how long the journey will take and when he will return. Nehemiah sets a time. He also asks for letters to the governors of the province Beyond the River, to grant him safe passage, and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, to supply him with timber for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the city wall, and for the house he will occupy. The king grants his requests because the gracious hand of God is upon him. When Nehemiah arrives and delivers the letters, the governors are accompanied by army officers and horsemen sent by the king. However, when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official hear of his arrival, they are very displeased that someone has come to promote the welfare of the Israelites. After three days in Jerusalem, Nehemiah secretly inspects the city walls by night, finding them in ruins. He then reveals his plan to the Jewish officials, priests, and nobles, telling them of God's gracious hand upon him and the king's support. They are encouraged and reply, "Let us rise up and build." But Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab mock and ridicule them, accusing them of rebelling against the king. Nehemiah replies that the God of heaven will give them success and that they, His servants, will start rebuilding, but that his opponents have no share, right, or claim in Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 3: Rebuilding the Wall of Jerusalem

This chapter provides a detailed account of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem. Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests begin the work by rebuilding the Sheep Gate, dedicating it and setting its doors in place. They continue the work as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. The work is divided into sections, with various groups of people taking responsibility for different parts of the wall. The men of Jericho build the section next to the priests, and Zaccur son of Imri builds next to them.

The text proceeds systematically around the city, listing the individuals, families, and guilds who repair each section. The sons of Hassenaah rebuild the Fish Gate, while Meremoth son of Uriah, Meshullam son of Berechiah, and Zadok son of Baana repair the sections next to it. The Tekoites also make repairs, although their nobles refuse to work under their supervisors. Other gates, such as the Old Gate, the Valley Gate, and the Dung Gate, are repaired by different rulers and residents. The work is a communal effort, with goldsmiths, perfume-makers, merchants, and rulers of various districts of Jerusalem participating. Many people, like Jedaiah son of Harumaph and Meshullam son of Berechiah, repair the section of the wall directly opposite their own houses. The chapter concludes by noting that the goldsmiths and the merchants complete the final section between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate.

## Nehemiah 4: Opposition and Perseverance

When Sanballat hears that the Jews are rebuilding the wall, he becomes angry and mocks them in front of his associates and the army of Samaria. He questions their ability to fortify themselves, offer sacrifices, and finish the work in a day, asking if they can bring the stones back to life from the heaps of rubble. Tobiah the Ammonite, who is with him, adds that even a fox climbing on their stone wall would break it down. Nehemiah prays to God, asking Him to turn their enemies' insults back on their own heads. Meanwhile, the people work with all their heart, and the wall is rebuilt to half its height.

When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod hear that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls are progressing and the gaps are being closed, they are furious. They all plot together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble. In response, the Jews pray to their God and post a guard day and night. The people of Judah, however, grow discouraged, saying the strength of the laborers is giving out and there is so much rubble that they cannot rebuild the wall. Their enemies plan a surprise attack, but the Jews who live near them warn Nehemiah and the builders ten times over. Nehemiah then stations people behind the lowest points of the wall with swords, spears, and bows. After inspecting the situation, he encourages the nobles, officials, and the rest of the people not to be afraid but to remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and to fight for their families and their homes. When their enemies learn that their plot is known and that God has frustrated it, the Jews all return to their work on the wall. From that day on, half of Nehemiah's men work while the other half stand guard with spears, shields, bows, and armor. The builders and laborers work with one hand and hold a weapon in the other. Nehemiah keeps a trumpeter by his side to sound the alarm if an attack comes, instructing the people to rally to that spot. They work from the first light of dawn until the stars come out, and Nehemiah and his men do not take off their clothes, even to wash them.

## Nehemiah 5: Nehemiah Helps the Poor

Some of the men and their wives raise a great outcry against their fellow Jews. Some are saying that they are mortgaging their fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine. Others say they are borrowing money on their fields and vineyards to pay the king's tax. Although they are of the same flesh and blood as their countrymen, they are forced to subject their sons and daughters to slavery, and some of their daughters have already been enslaved, but they are powerless to redeem them because their fields and vineyards belong to others.

When Nehemiah hears their outcry, he is very angry. He rebukes the nobles and officials, accusing them of exacting usury from their own people. He calls a large assembly to deal with the matter and tells them that they have been buying back their Jewish brothers who had been sold to the Gentiles, yet now they are selling their own brothers. The nobles and officials are silent. Nehemiah then instructs them to stop charging interest and to give back the fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses they have taken, as well as the interest they have been charging. They agree to do so and to require nothing more from the people. Nehemiah summons the priests and makes the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they have promised. He then shakes out the folds of his robe and says that in the same way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep his promise. The whole assembly says, "Amen," and praises the Lord, and the people do as they have promised. For twelve years, from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, neither Nehemiah nor his brothers eat the food allotted to the governor. The former governors had placed a heavy burden on the people, but out of reverence for God, Nehemiah does not do so. Instead, he devotes himself to the work on the wall, and all his men are gathered there for the work. He also provides food for 150 Jews and officials at his table, as well as for those who come from surrounding nations, all at his own expense.

## Nehemiah 6: The Wall Is Completed

Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of their enemies hear that Nehemiah has rebuilt the wall and that no gaps are left, though the doors have not yet been set in the gates. They send him a message, inviting him to meet them in one of the villages on the plain of Ono. However, they are plotting to harm him. Nehemiah sends messengers back with the reply that he is carrying on a great project and cannot go down, as the work would stop if he left it. They send him the same message four times, and each time he gives the same answer. The fifth time, Sanballat sends his aide with an open letter, which claims that it is reported among the nations that Nehemiah and the Jews are plotting to revolt and that he is building the wall to become their king. The letter also alleges that Nehemiah has appointed prophets to proclaim him king in Jerusalem. Sanballat threatens to report this to the king and again invites Nehemiah to meet. Nehemiah replies that nothing they are saying is happening and that they are just making it up in their own minds. He prays for God to strengthen his hands.

Later, Nehemiah goes to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, who is shut in at his home. Shemaiah urges him to meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and to lock the doors, because men are coming to kill him by night. But Nehemiah refuses, asking why a man like him should run away or go into the temple to save his life. He realizes that God had not sent Shemaiah, but that he had been hired by Tobiah and Sanballat to prophesy against him and intimidate him into sinning. Nehemiah prays that God will remember what his enemies have done. The wall is finally completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, in just fifty-two days. When all their enemies and the surrounding nations hear about it, they are afraid and lose their self-confidence, because they realize that this work had been done with the help of God. During this time, the nobles of Judah continue to send many letters to Tobiah, and he replies to them, for many in Judah are bound by oath to him. They keep reporting Nehemiah's good deeds to Tobiah and then report Tobiah's words back to Nehemiah, as Tobiah continues to send letters to intimidate him.

## Nehemiah 7: The List of Exiles Who Returned

After the wall has been rebuilt and the doors set in place, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites are appointed. Nehemiah puts his brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because Hananiah is a man of integrity and fears God more than most men do. Nehemiah instructs them not to open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot and to shut and bar them while the guards are still on duty. He also appoints residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at guard posts and some near their own houses. The city is large and spacious, but there are few people in it, and the houses have not yet been rebuilt. God puts it into Nehemiah's heart to assemble the nobles, officials, and the common people for registration by genealogy.

He finds the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return from the exile. The record lists the men of the people of Israel who returned with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, and other leaders. It provides a detailed census of the families and the number of men from each, as well as the number of men from various towns. The priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants are also listed by their families. The total number of people in the whole assembly is 42,360, besides their male and female servants, and their horses, mules, camels, and donkeys. Some of the heads of the families contribute to the work. The governor gives a thousand drachmas of gold, fifty basins, and 530 priestly garments to the treasury. Other family heads and the rest of the people also give thousands of drachmas of gold and thousands of minas of silver. The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, some of the people, and the temple servants, all the Israelites, settle in their own towns.

## Nehemiah 8: Ezra Reads the Law

When the seventh month comes and the Israelites have settled in their towns, all the people gather as one in the square before the Water Gate. They ask Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded for Israel. On the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brings the Law before the assembly, which includes men, women, and all who are able to understand. He reads it aloud from early morning until midday, and all the people listen attentively. Ezra stands on a high wooden platform built for the occasion, with other leaders standing on his right and on his left.

Ezra opens the book in the sight of all the people, and as he does, they all stand up. He praises the Lord, the great God, and all the people lift their hands and respond, "Amen! Amen!" Then they bow down and worship the Lord with their faces to the ground. A group of Levites, including Jeshua, Bani, and Sherebiah, instruct the people in the Law while they are standing there. They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people can understand what is being read. When the people hear the words of the Law, they weep. But Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who are instructing the people tell them that this day is sacred to the Lord their God and that they should not mourn or weep. Nehemiah tells them to go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks and to send some to those who have nothing prepared, for the day is holy. He encourages them not to grieve, because the joy of the Lord is their strength. The Levites calm the people, and they all go away to eat, drink, send portions of food, and celebrate with great joy, because they now understand the words that had been made known to them. On the second day, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and Levites, gather around Ezra to study the words of the Law. They find written that the Israelites are to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month. They proclaim this in all their towns and in Jerusalem, and the people go out to gather branches to build booths on their roofs, in their courtyards, and in the squares. The whole company that has returned from exile builds booths and lives in them. For the first time since the days of Joshua son of Nun, there is great joy. Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra reads from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrate the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day they hold a solemn assembly, in accordance with the regulation.

## Nehemiah 9: The Israelites Confess Their Sins

On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gather together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and with dust on their heads. Those of Israelite descent separate themselves from all foreigners, and they stand and confess their own sins and the iniquities of their fathers. They stand in their places and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day, and spend another quarter in confession and in worshiping the Lord their God.

A group of Levites stands on the stairs and calls out to the Lord their God with a loud voice. Then the Levites lead the people in a long prayer of praise and confession. They bless the glorious name of God, acknowledging Him as the sole Lord and Creator of the heavens, the earth, and the seas, and all that is in them. The prayer recounts the history of God's relationship with Israel, beginning with the choosing of Abram, the covenant made with him, and the deliverance of their ancestors from slavery in Egypt. It recalls God's miraculous signs and wonders, the parting of the Red Sea, and His guidance through the wilderness with pillars of cloud and fire. The prayer acknowledges that God gave them just laws and good decrees on Mount Sinai, provided them with bread from heaven and water from the rock, and sustained them for forty years in the desert. It confesses that despite God's faithfulness, their ancestors became arrogant and disobedient, refusing to heed His commands and making a golden calf. Yet, in His great mercy, God did not abandon them. The prayer continues to recount how God gave them victory over kingdoms, multiplied their descendants, and gave them a rich land. But they were disobedient and rebellious, killing the prophets who warned them to turn back to God. When they cried out in their distress, God, in His great mercy, sent them saviors. The prayer concludes by acknowledging God's justice in all that has happened to them. They confess that they are now slaves in the very land God gave their ancestors, and its abundant harvest goes to the kings set over them because of their sins. Because of all this, they make a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and their leaders, Levites, and priests seal it.

## Nehemiah 10: The Agreement of the People

This chapter lists the names of those who seal the binding agreement. The list is headed by Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah. It is followed by the names of the priests, the Levites, and the leaders of the people. The rest of the people—priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants, and all who have separated themselves from the neighboring peoples for the sake of the Law of God, together with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand—all join their brethren the nobles in taking an oath with a curse upon themselves. They bind themselves to follow the Law of God given through Moses and to obey all the commands, ordinances, and statutes of the Lord.

The agreement includes several specific commitments. They promise not to give their daughters in marriage to the peoples around them or take their daughters for their sons. They agree that if the neighboring peoples bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath, they will not buy from them on that day or on any other holy day. Every seventh year, they will forgo working the land and will cancel all debts. They also take on the responsibility of providing for the service of the house of God by giving a third of a shekel each year. They agree to cast lots for the wood offering, to bring it to the house of God at the appointed times. They also commit to bringing the firstfruits of their crops and of every fruit tree, as well as the firstborn of their sons and of their cattle, as written in the Law. They promise to bring the first of their ground meal, of their grain offerings, of the fruit of all their trees, and of their new wine and oil to the priests at the storerooms of the house of God. They will also bring the tithes of their crops to the Levites. They resolve not to neglect the house of their God.

## Nehemiah 11: The New Residents of Jerusalem

The leaders of the people settle in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in the holy city, while the remaining nine stay in their own towns. The people bless all the men who volunteer to live in Jerusalem. The chapter then lists the provincial leaders who live in Jerusalem. The Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and descendants of Solomon's servants live in their own towns in Judah. A list of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin who settle in Jerusalem follows, with the names of their leaders and the number of men under them.

The text also provides a detailed list of the priests and their leaders who live in Jerusalem, along with the number of men responsible for the work of the temple. The Levites who settle in the city are also listed, with their leaders and responsibilities, including being in charge of the outside work of the house of God and leading in thanksgiving and prayer. The singers, descendants of Asaph, are also mentioned. The temple servants live on the hill of Ophel. The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem is Uzzi, a descendant of Asaph. The chapter concludes with a list of the towns where the rest of the Israelites, priests, and Levites live, scattered throughout Judah, each on his own property.

## Nehemiah 12: Priests, Levites, and the Dedication of the Wall

This chapter begins with a list of the priests and Levites who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua. It names the leading priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua. A genealogy of the high priests is then given, from Jeshua down to Jaddua. The heads of the priestly families in the days of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua, are also recorded. The Levites are recorded as heads of families in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, and the priests are also recorded during the reign of Darius the Persian. The heads of the Levitical families are written in the book of the annals.

For the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites are brought from all over Judah to celebrate with gladness, thanksgiving, and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. The singers are also gathered from the region around Jerusalem. The priests and Levites purify themselves, the people, the gates, and the wall. Nehemiah brings the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall and appoints two large choirs to give thanks. One choir proceeds to the right, toward the Dung Gate, followed by half of the leaders of Judah. The other choir proceeds to the left, with Nehemiah and the other half of the leaders following. The two choirs take their places in the house of God, and the singers sing loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah. On that day, they offer great sacrifices, rejoicing because God has given them great joy. The women and children also rejoice, and the sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem is heard far away. Men are appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. Judah rejoices over the ministering priests and Levites, who perform the service of their God and the service of purification, as do the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon.

## Nehemiah 13: Nehemiah's Final Reforms

On that day, the Book of Moses is read aloud in the hearing of the people, and they find written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God, because they had not met the Israelites with bread and water but had hired Balaam to curse them. When the people hear this law, they exclude from Israel all who are of foreign descent. Before this, Eliashib the priest, who is in charge of the storerooms of the house of God, had provided a large room for Tobiah the Ammonite, an enemy of the Jews. This room was previously used to store the grain offerings, incense, and temple articles. Nehemiah had been away in Babylon, but when he returns to Jerusalem, he is deeply grieved to learn of the evil that Eliashib has done. He throws all of Tobiah's household goods out of the room and orders the rooms to be purified. Then he brings back the articles of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the frankincense.

Nehemiah also discovers that the portions designated for the Levites have not been given to them, and as a result, the Levites and singers responsible for the service have gone back to their own fields. He rebukes the officials, asking why the house of God is forsaken. He then gathers the Levites and singers and restores them to their positions. All Judah brings the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms. Nehemiah appoints treasurers to be in charge of the storerooms, for they are considered trustworthy, and their duty is to distribute the portions to their fellow Levites. In those days, Nehemiah sees people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads. He warns them against selling food on the Sabbath. He also confronts the nobles of Judah, rebuking them for profaning the Sabbath day. He orders the gates of Jerusalem to be shut just before the Sabbath and not to be opened until it is over. He stations some of his own men at the gates to ensure that no load is brought in. When merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spend the night outside Jerusalem once or twice, he warns them that if they do it again, he will lay hands on them. From then on, they do not come on the Sabbath. He also commands the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. Nehemiah also sees that some Jews have married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. Half of their children speak the language of Ashdod or the language of other peoples and do not know how to speak the language of Judah. He confronts them, calls down curses on them, beats some of them, and pulls out their hair. He makes them take an oath in God's name not to give their daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for their sons or for themselves. He reminds them that King Solomon of Israel sinned because of foreign women. He chases away one of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, because he had become the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. Nehemiah thus purifies the priesthood and the Levites from everything foreign and establishes the duties for them. He also makes arrangements for the wood offering at appointed times and for the firstfruits. He concludes the book with the prayer, "Remember me, O my God, for good."
