## Philippians 1: Thanksgiving, Prayer, and Joy in Suffering

Paul and Timotheus address the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, along with the bishops and deacons. Paul thanks God every time he remembers them and says he prays for them with joy because they share in the gospel from the first day until now. He expresses confidence that God will continue the work begun in them until the day of Jesus Christ. He says he longs for them with deep affection and prays that their love grows in knowledge and judgment so they approve what is excellent and remain sincere until Christ's day.

Paul explains that his imprisonment has advanced the gospel. The palace guard and others know he is in bonds for Christ. Some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, others out of goodwill. Paul says Christ is preached either way, and he rejoices. He expects that through their prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this will turn to his salvation. He declares that for him to live is Christ and to die is gain. He urges them to conduct themselves worthy of the gospel, standing firm in one spirit and not fearing opponents.

## Philippians 2: The Mind of Christ and Humility

Paul urges them to be united in mind and love, valuing others above themselves. He tells them to look not only to their own interests but also to the interests of others. He describes Jesus Christ, who exists in the form of God yet makes himself of no reputation, takes the form of a servant, and becomes obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. God highly exalts him and gives him a name above every name, so that every knee bows and every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord.

Paul tells them to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for God works in them to will and to do his good pleasure. He instructs them to do all things without complaining or arguing. He says he sends Timotheus soon to know their state, describing him as one who naturally cares for them. He also sends Epaphroditus, who nearly dies for the work of Christ but recovers through God's mercy.

## Philippians 3: Righteousness Through Faith and Pressing Toward the Mark

Paul warns them to beware of dogs and evil workers and speaks against those who trust in the flesh. He lists his own background: circumcised the eighth day, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Pharisee, zealous in persecuting the church, blameless under the law. He says he counts these things as loss for Christ. He desires to know Christ, the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

He tells them to follow his example and notes that many walk as enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction and whose mind is set on earthly things. He says their citizenship is in heaven, from where they look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Philippians 4: Rejoice, Pray, Think on These Things

Paul urges Euodias and Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord and asks a true companion to help these women who labor with him in the gospel, along with Clement and others. He commands them to rejoice always and to let their moderation be known to all. He tells them not to worry but to present their requests to God in prayer, promising that the peace of God will guard their hearts and minds.

He instructs them to think on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report. Paul thanks them for their renewed care for him and explains that he has learned to be content in every state, whether abased or abounding. He says he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. He acknowledges their gift as a sacrifice acceptable to God and assures them that God will supply all their need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. He closes with greetings and grace.
